    <h1>Since the Savior Found Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">Since the Savior found me, pardoned all my sin, I have had the joy of living hope within; Gone is the shame and sorrow of the past, they&rsquo;re underneath the precious blood of Christ at last.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved, saved, saved &ndash; I&rsquo;m, happy on the way, Saved, saved, saved &ndash; I love Him more each day; Saved, saved, saved I know he&rsquo;s mine each hour: He saves and keeps and sanctifies me by his pow&rsquo;r.</p>
    <p class="verse">Since the Savior found me all to Him I owe, For His precious blood has washed me white as snow; Now no condemnation, happy as can be &ndash; I&rsquo;m glad that Jesus justifies and sets me free.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved, saved, saved &ndash; I&rsquo;m, happy on the way, Saved, saved, saved &ndash; I love Him more each day; Saved, saved, saved I know he&rsquo;s mine each hour: He saves and keeps and sanctifies me by his pow&rsquo;r.</p>
    <p class="verse">Since the Savior found me I have perfect rest, Living in the realms of joy and happiness; Leaning on my Savior, looking for that day When He shall come to catch His waiting bride away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved, saved, saved &ndash; I&rsquo;m, happy on the way, Saved, saved, saved &ndash; I love Him more each day; Saved, saved, saved I know he&rsquo;s mine each hour: He saves and keeps and sanctifies me by his pow&rsquo;r.</p>
