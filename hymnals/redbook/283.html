    <h1>Yesterday, Today, Forever</h1>
    <p class="verse">O how sweet the glorious message Simple faith may claim: Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same! Still He loves to save the sinful, Heal the sick and lame, Cheer the mourner, calm the tempest&mdash;Glory to His name!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same; All may change, but Jesus never Glory to His name! &ndash; Glory to His name! Glory to His name! All may change, but Jesus never &ndash; Glory to his name!</p>
    <p class="verse">He who pardoned erring Peter Never need&rsquo;st thou fear, He who came to faithless Thomas, All thy doubt will clear; He who let the loved disciple On His bosom rest Bids thee still with love as tender, Lean upon His breast.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same; All may change, but Jesus never Glory to His name! &ndash; Glory to His name! Glory to His name! All may change, but Jesus never &ndash; Glory to his name!</p>
    <p class="verse">He who &rsquo;mid the raging billows Walked upon the sea, Still can hush our wildest tempest, As on Galilee; He who wept and prayed in anguish In Gethsemane, Drinks with us each cup of trembling, In our agony.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same; All may change, but Jesus never Glory to His name! &ndash; Glory to His name! Glory to His name! All may change, but Jesus never &ndash; Glory to his name!</p>
    <p class="verse">As of old He walked to Emmaus, With them to abide, So thru all life&rsquo;s way He walketh, Ever near our side; Soon again shall we behold Him-- Hasten, Lord, the day! But &lsquo;twill still be &ldquo;this same Jesus&rdquo; As He went away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yesterday, today, forever, Jesus is the same; All may change, but Jesus never Glory to His name! &ndash; Glory to His name! Glory to His name! All may change, but Jesus never &ndash; Glory to his name!</p>
