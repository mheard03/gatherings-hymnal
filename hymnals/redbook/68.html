    <h1>O Day of Rest and Gladness</h1>
    <p class="verse">O day of rest and gladness, O day of joy and light, O balm of care and sadness, most beautiful, most bright: On Thee, the high and lowly, thru ages joined in tune, Sing &ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy&rdquo;, to the great God Triune.</p>
    <p class="verse">On Thee, at the creation, the light first had its birth; On Thee, for our salvation, Christ rose from depths of earth; On Thee, our Lord, victorious, the Spirit sent from heaven, And thus on Thee, most glorious, a triple light was given.</p>
    <p class="verse">Today on weary nations the heavenly manna falls; To holy convocations the silver trumpet calls, Where Gospel light is glowing with pure and radiant beams, And living water flowing, with soul refreshing streams.</p>
    <p class="verse">New graces ever gaining from this our day of rest, We reach the rest remaining to spirits of the blessed. To Holy Ghost be praises, to Father, and to Son; The church her voice upraises to Thee, blessed Three in One.</p>
