    <h1>Open Wide Ye Doors</h1>
    <p class="verse">Open wide, ye everlasting doors, Let the King of Glory in; Now returning from His earthly wars, He the victory did win. See the rich red wounds He bears, Scars of battle now He wears He has wrested Satan&rsquo;s throne He must reign and He alone! Rise to meet and welcome Him: Crown Him, saints and seraphim.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Open wide, ye everlasting doors, Let the King of Glory in; Now returning from His earthly wars, He the victory did win!</p>
    <p class="verse">Choiring angels, come and wait before Him, He is worthy of thy praise; With all heaven worship and adore Him, Holy hymns and anthems raise. He the lamb who bled and died, On the cross was crucified, Tasting death for every man; This the great redemptive plan! Conqueror of death and hell. See &ndash; He lives and a is well!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Open wide, ye everlasting doors, Let the King of Glory in; Now returning from His earthly wars, He the victory did win!</p>
    <p class="verse">And some day &ndash; O thrilling truth to ponder &ndash; Christ is coming back again! Breaking thru the silent sky up yonder, Ev&rsquo;ry eye shall see Him then. Coming back in power to reign, Myriad armies in His train, All the earth shall know His sway, Ev&rsquo;ry knee will bow that day; Even so, come, Lord divine, Take the throne that&rsquo;s rightly Thine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glorious promise that cannot be broken, How it cheers the hearts of men! Christ himself the blessed truth has spoken &ndash; He is coming back again!</p>
