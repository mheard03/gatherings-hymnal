    <h1>Surely Goodness and Mercy</h1>
    <p class="verse">A pilgrim was I, and awand&rsquo;ring, In the cold night of sin I did roam, When Jesus the kind Shepherd found me, And Now I am on my Way home.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, all the days of my life; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, alI the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever, And I shall feast at the table spread for me; Sirely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, all the days of my life, All the days, all the days of my life.</p>
    <p class="verse">He restoreth my soul when I&rsquo;m weary, He giveth me strength day by day; He leads me beside the still waters, He guards me each step of the way</p>
    <p class="chorus">Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, all the days of my life; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, alI the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever, And I shall feast at the table spread for me; Sirely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, all the days of my life, All the days, all the days of my life.</p>
    <p class="verse">When I walk thru the dark lonesome valley, My Savior will walk with me there; And safely His great hand will lead me To the mansions He&rsquo;s gone to prepare.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, all the days of my life; Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, alI the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever, And I shall feast at the table spread for me; Sirely goodness and mercy shall follow me All the days, all the days of my life, All the days, all the days of my life.</p>
