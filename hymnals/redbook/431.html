    <h1>I Love to Tell the Story</h1>
    <p class="verse">I love to tell the story of unseen things above, Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love. I love to tell the story, because I know &rsquo;tis true; It satisfies my longings as nothing else can do.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I love to tell the story, &rsquo;twill be my theme in glory, To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.</p>
    <p class="verse">I love to tell the story; more wonderful it seems Than all the golden fancies of all our golden dreams. I love to tell the story, it did so much for me; And that is just the reason I tell it now to thee.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I love to tell the story, &rsquo;twill be my theme in glory, To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.</p>
    <p class="verse">I love to tell the story; &rsquo;tis pleasant to repeat What seems, each time I tell it, more wonderfully sweet. I love to tell the story, for some have never heard The message of salvation from God&rsquo;s own holy Word.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I love to tell the story, &rsquo;twill be my theme in glory, To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.</p>
    <p class="verse">I love to tell the story, for those who know it best Seem hungering and thirsting to hear it like the rest. And when, in scenes of glory, I sing the new, new song, &rsquo;Twill be the old, old story that I have loved so long.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I love to tell the story, &rsquo;twill be my theme in glory, To tell the old, old story of Jesus and His love.</p>
