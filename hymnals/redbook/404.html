    <h1>The Fight Is On</h1>
    <p class="verse">The fight is on, the trumpet sound is ringing out, The cry &ldquo;To arms!&rdquo; is heard afar and near; The Lord of hosts is marching on to victory, The triumph of the Christ will soon appear.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The fight is on, O Christian soldier, And face to face in stern array, With armor gleaming, and colors streaming, The right and wrong engage today! The fight is on, but be not weary; Be strong, and in His might hold fast; If God be for us, His banner o&rsquo;er us, We&rsquo;ll sing the victor&rsquo;s song at last!</p>
    <p class="verse">The fight is on, arouse, ye soldiers brave and true! Jehovah leads, and vict&rsquo;ry will assure; Go buckle on the armor God has given you, And in His strength unto the end endure.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The fight is on, O Christian soldier, And face to face in stern array, With armor gleaming, and colors streaming, The right and wrong engage today! The fight is on, but be not weary; Be strong, and in His might hold fast; If God be for us, His banner o&rsquo;er us, We&rsquo;ll sing the victor&rsquo;s song at last!</p>
    <p class="verse">The Lord is leading on to certain victory The bow of promise spans the eastern sky; His glorious Name in every land shall honored be; The morn will break, the dawn of peace is nigh.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The fight is on, O Christian soldier, And face to face in stern array, With armor gleaming, and colors streaming, The right and wrong engage today! The fight is on, but be not weary; Be strong, and in His might hold fast; If God be for us, His banner o&rsquo;er us, We&rsquo;ll sing the victor&rsquo;s song at last!</p>
