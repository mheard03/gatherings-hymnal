    <h1>We Would See Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">We would see Jesus for the shadows lengthen Across this little landscape of our life; We would see Jesus, our weak faith to strengthen For the last weariness, the final strife.</p>
    <p class="verse">We would see Jesus the great rock Foundation Whereon our feet were set with sovereign grace; Not life nor death, with all their agitation, Can thence remove us, if we see His face.</p>
    <p class="verse">We would see Jesus other lights are paling, Which for long years we have rejoiced to see; The blessings of our pilgrimage are failing; We would not mourn them, for we go to Thee.</p>
    <p class="verse">We would see Jesus this is all we&rsquo;re needing; Strength, joy, and willingness come with the sight; We would see Jesus dying, risen, pleading; Then welcome day! and farewell mortal night!</p>
