    <h1>Ivory Palaces</h1>
    <p class="verse">My Lord has garments so wondrous fine, And myrrh their texture fills; Its fragrance reached to this heart of mine With joy my being thrills.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Out of the ivory palaces, Into a world of woe, Only His great eternal love Made my Savior go.</p>
    <p class="verse">His life had also its sorrows sore, For aloes had a part; And when I think of the cross He bore, My eyes with teardrops start.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Out of the ivory palaces, Into a world of woe, Only His great eternal love Made my Savior go.</p>
    <p class="verse">His garments, too, were in cassia dipped, With healing in a touch; Esch time my feetin some sin have slipped&mdash;He took me from its clutch.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Out of the ivory palaces, Into a world of woe, Only His great eternal love Made my Savior go.</p>
    <p class="verse">In garments glorious He will come, To open wide the door; And I shall enter my heav&rsquo;nly home, To dwell forevermore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Out of the ivory palaces, Into a world of woe, Only His great eternal love Made my Savior go.</p>
