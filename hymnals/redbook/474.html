    <h1>Only a Sinner</h1>
    <p class="verse">Naught have I gotten but what I received; Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed; Boasting excluded, pride I abase; I&rsquo;m only a sinner, saved by grace!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Only a sinner, saved by grace! Only a sinner, saved by grace! This is my story, to God be the glory - I&rsquo;m only a sinner, saved by grace!</p>
    <p class="verse">Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart, Causing my footsteps from God to depart; Jesus hath found me, happy my case; I now am a sinner, saved by grace!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Only a sinner, saved by grace! Only a sinner, saved by grace! This is my story, to God be the glory - I&rsquo;m only a sinner, saved by grace!</p>
    <p class="verse">Tears unavailing, no merit had I; Mercy had saved me, or else I must die; Sin had alarmed me fearing God&rsquo;s face; But now I&rsquo;m a sinner saved by grace!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Only a sinner, saved by grace! Only a sinner, saved by grace! This is my story, to God be the glory - I&rsquo;m only a sinner, saved by grace!</p>
    <p class="verse">Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows, Loving his Savior to tell what he knows; Once more to tell it would I embrace - I&rsquo;m only a sinner saved by grace!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Only a sinner, saved by grace! Only a sinner, saved by grace! This is my story, to God be the glory - I&rsquo;m only a sinner, saved by grace!</p>
