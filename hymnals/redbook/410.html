    <h1>The Banner of the Cross</h1>
    <p class="verse">There's a royal banner given for display To the soldiers of the King; As an ensign fair we lift it up today, While as ransomed ones we sing.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Marching on, marching on, For Christ count ev'rything but loss! And to crown Him King, toil and sing 'Neath the banner of the cross!</p>
    <p class="verse">Though the foe may rage and gather as the flood, Let the standard be displayed; And beneath its folds, as soldiers of the Lord, For the truth be not dismayed!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Marching on, marching on, For Christ count ev'rything but loss! And to crown Him King, toil and sing 'Neath the banner of the cross!</p>
    <p class="verse">Over land and sea, wherever man may dwell, Make the glorious tidings known; Of the crimson banner now the story tell, While the Lord shall claim his own!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Marching on, marching on, For Christ count ev'rything but loss! And to crown Him King, toil and sing 'Neath the banner of the cross!</p>
    <p class="verse">When the glory dawns, 'tis drawing very near, It is hast'ning day by day, Then before our King the foe shall disappear, And the cross the world shall sway!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Marching on, marching on, For Christ count ev'rything but loss! And to crown Him King, toil and sing 'Neath the banner of the cross!</p>
