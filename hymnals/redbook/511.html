    <h1>Face to Face</h1>
    <p class="verse">Face to face with Christ, my Savior, Face to face -- what will it be? When with rapture I behold Him, Jesus Christ who died for me!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Face to face I shall behold Him, Far beyond the starry sky; Face to face, in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by!</p>
    <p class="verse">Only faintly now I see Him, With the darkling veil between; But the blessed day is coming, When His glory shall be seen.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Face to face I shall behold Him, Far beyond the starry sky; Face to face, in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by!</p>
    <p class="verse">What rejoicing in His presence, When are banished grief and pain, When the crooked ways are straightened And the dark things shall be plain.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Face to face I shall behold Him, Far beyond the starry sky; Face to face, in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by! 4.</p>
    <p class="verse">Face to face &ndash; O blissful moment! Face to face &ndash; to see and know. Face to face with my Redeemer, Jesus Christ who loves me so!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Face to face I shall behold Him, Far beyond the starry sky; Face to face, in all His glory, I shall see Him by and by!</p>
