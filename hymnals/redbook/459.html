    <h1>He Lifted Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">In loving-kindness Jesus came, My soul in mercy to reclaim, And from the depths of sin and shame Thru grace He lifted me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">From sinking sand He lifted me, With tender hand He lifted me; From shades of night to plains of light, Oh, praise His Name, He lifted me!</p>
    <p class="verse">He called me long before I heard, Before my sinful heart was stirred, But when I took Him at His word, Forgiv&rsquo;n, He lifted me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">From sinking sand He lifted me, With tender hand He lifted me; From shades of night to plains of light, Oh, praise His Name, He lifted me!</p>
    <p class="verse">His brow was pierced with many a thorn, His hands by cruel nails were torn, When from my guilt and grief, forlorn, In love He lifted me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">From sinking sand He lifted me, With tender hand He lifted me; From shades of night to plains of light, Oh, praise His Name, He lifted me!</p>
    <p class="verse">Now on a higher plane I dwell, And with my soul I know &rsquo;tis well; Yet how or why, I cannot tell, He should have lifted me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">From sinking sand He lifted me, With tender hand He lifted me; From shades of night to plains of light, Oh, praise His Name, He lifted me!</p>
