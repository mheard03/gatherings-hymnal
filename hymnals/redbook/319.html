    <h1>I Would Be True</h1>
    <p class="verse">I would be true, for there are those who trust me; I would be pure, for there are those who care; I would be strong, for there is much to suffer; I would be brave, for there is much to dare; I would be brave, for there is much to dare.</p>
    <p class="verse">I would be friend of all -the foe, the friendless; I would be giving, and forget the gift; I would be humble, for I know my weakness; I would look up, and laugh, and love and lift. I would look up, and laugh, and love and lift.</p>
    <p class="verse">I would be prayerful thru each busy moment; I would be constantly in touch with God; I would be tuned to hear His slightest whisper, I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod; I would have faith to keep the path Christ trod.</p>
