    <h1>Jesus is Calling</h1>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is tenderly calling thee home Calling today, calling today, Why from the sunshine of love wilt you roam, Farther and farther away?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Calling today, calling today, Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is calling the weary to rest, Calling today, calling today, Bring Him thy burden and thou shalt be blest; He will not turn thee away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Calling today, Calling today, Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is waiting, O come to Him now, Waiting today, waiting today, Come with thy sins, at His feet lowly bow; Come, and no longer delay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Calling today, calling today, Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is pleading, O list to His voice, Hear Him today, hear Him today, They who believe on His Name shall rejoice; Quickly arise and away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Calling today, calling today, Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.</p>
