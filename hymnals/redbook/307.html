    <h1>I With Thee Would Begin</h1>
    <p class="verse">I with Thee would begin, O my Savior so dear, On the way that I still must pursue; I with Thee would begin every day granted here, As my earnest resolve I renew To be and remain Thine forever.</p>
    <p class="verse">I with Thee would begin and go forth in Thy Name, Which alone doth salvation bestow; Fold me close to Thy breast where found joy all who came, There is refuge for me, too, I know, Though all in this world is confusion.</p>
    <p class="verse">Let Thy Word all divine be my lamp in whose light I may constantly keep to Thy way; And each day wouldst Thou cleanse me anew, make me white In the blood shed for me on that day When death Thou didst suffer, Lord Jesus.</p>
    <p class="verse">I with Thee would begin -yea, and hear one more prayer, I would close with Thee, too, my brief day, And when daylight has failed, let me sleep in Thy care, Until waking Thy child Thou dost say, &ldquo;Come, live with Me ever in Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
