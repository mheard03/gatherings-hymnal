    <h1>That Beautiful Name</h1>
    <p class="verse">I know of a name, A beautiful name, That angels brought down to earth; They whispered it low, One night long ago, To a maiden of lowly birth.</p>
    <p class="chorus">That beautiful Name, That beautiful Name, From sin has power to free us! That beautiful Name, That wonderful Name, That matchless Name is Jesus!</p>
    <p class="verse">I know of a Name, A beautiful Name, That unto a Babe was given; The stars glittered bright Thru-out that glad night, And angels praised God in Heav'n.</p>
    <p class="chorus">That beautiful Name, That beautiful Name, From sin has power to free us! That beautiful Name, That wonderful Name, That matchless Name is Jesus!</p>
    <p class="verse">The One of that Name, My Savior became, My Savior of Calvary. My sins nailed Him there; My burdens He bare. He suffered all this for me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">That beautiful Name, That beautiful Name From sin has power to free us! That beautiful Name, That wonderful Name, That matchless Name is Jesus!</p>
    <p class="verse">I love that blest Name, that wonderful Name, Made higher than all in Heav'n 'Twas whispered, I know, In my heart long ago To Jesus my life I've giv&rsquo;n.</p>
    <p class="chorus">That beautiful Name, That beautiful Name, From sin has power to free us! That beautiful Name, That wonderful Name, That matchless Name is Jesus!</p>
