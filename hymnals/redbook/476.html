    <h1>It is Glory Just to Walk With Him</h1>
    <p class="verse">It is glory just to walk with Him Whose blood has ransomed me; It is rapture for my soul each day. It is joy divine to feel Him near where&rsquo;er my path may be. Bless the Lord, it&rsquo;s glory all the way!</p>
    <p class="chorus">It is glory just to walk with Him, It is glory just to walk with Him, He will guide my steps aright Thru the vale and o&rsquo;er the height, It is glory just to walk with Him.</p>
    <p class="verse">It is glory when the shadows fall to know that He is near. O what joy to simply trust and pray! It is glory to abide in Him when skies above are clear. Yes, with Him, it&rsquo;s glory all the way!</p>
    <p class="chorus">It is glory just to walk with Him, It is glory just to walk with Him, He will guide my steps aright Thru the vale and o&rsquo;er the height, It is glory just to walk with Him.</p>
    <p class="verse">Twill be glory when I walk with Him on Heaven&rsquo;s golden shore, Never from His side again to stray. &rsquo;Twill be glory, wondrous glory with the Savior evermore, Everlasting glory all the way!</p>
    <p class="chorus">It is glory just to walk with Him, It is glory just to walk with Him, He will guide my steps aright Thru the vale and o&rsquo;er the height, It is glory just to walk with Him.</p>
