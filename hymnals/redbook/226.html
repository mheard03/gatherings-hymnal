    <h1>My Savior</h1>
    <p class="verse">I am not skilled to understand What God hath willed, what God hath planned; I only know at His right hand is One who is my Savior.</p>
    <p class="verse">I take Him at His word indeed: &quot;Christ died for sinners&quot;&mdash;this I read; For in my heart I find a need Of Him to be my Savior!</p>
    <p class="verse">That He should leave His place on high And come for sinful man to die, You count it strange? So once did I Before I knew my Savior!</p>
    <p class="verse">And, oh, that He fulfilled may see The travail of His soul in me, And with His work contented be, As I with my dear Savior!</p>
    <p class="verse">Yes, living, dying, let me bring My strength, my solace from this spring&mdash;That He who lives to be my King Once died to be my Savior!</p>
