    <h1>Wonderful Grace of Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">Wonderful grace of Jesus, Greater than all my sin; How shall my tongue describe it, Where shall its praise begin? Taking away my burden, Setting my spirit free; For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus, Deeper than the mighty rolling sea; Higher than the mountain, sparling like a fountain, All sufficient grace for even me, Broader than the scope of my transgressions, Greater far than all my sin and shame, O magnify the precious Name of Jesus Praise His Name!</p>
    <p class="verse">Wonderful grace of Jesus, Reaching to all the lost, By it I have been pardoned Saved to the uttermost, Chains have been torn asunder, Giving me liberty; For the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus, Deeper than the mighty rolling sea; Higher than the mountain, sparling like a fountain, All sufficient grace for even me, Broader than the scope of my transgressions, Greater far than all my sin and shame, O magnify the precious Name of Jesus Praise His Name!</p>
    <p class="verse">Wonderful grace of Jesus, Reaching the most defiled, By its transforming power, Making him God&rsquo;s dear child, Purchasing peace and heaven, For all eternity; And the wonderful grace of Jesus reaches me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Wonderful the matchless grace of Jesus, Deeper than the mighty rolling sea; Higher than the mountain, sparling like a fountain, All sufficient grace for even me, Broader than the scope of my transgressions, Greater far than all my sin and shame, O magnify the precious Name of Jesus Praise His Name!</p>
