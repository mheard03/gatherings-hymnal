    <h1>In the Garden</h1>
    <p class="verse">I come to the garden alone, While the dew is still on the roses; And the voice I hear, falling on my ear, The Son of God discloses.</p>
    <p class="chorus">And He walks with me, And He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own, And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.</p>
    <p class="verse">He speaks, and the sound of His voice Is so sweet the birds hush their singing; And the melody that He gave to me Within my heart is ringing.</p>
    <p class="chorus">And He walks with me, And He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own, And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.</p>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;d stay in the garden with Him Tho the night around me be falling; But He bids me go-- thru the voice of woe, His voice to me is calling.</p>
    <p class="chorus">And He walks with me, And He talks with me, And He tells me I am His own, And the joy we share as we tarry there, None other has ever known.</p>
