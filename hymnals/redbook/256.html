    <h1>It Is Well with My Soul</h1>
    <p class="verse">When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea-billows roll Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It is well-- with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tho Satan should buffet, tho trials should come, Let this blest assurance control, That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate, And hath shed His own blood for my soul.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It is well-- with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">My sin- O the bliss of this glorious tho&rsquo;t- My sin, not in part, but the whole, Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, Oh my soul.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It is well-- with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">And, Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight, The clouds be rolled back as a scroll: The trump shall resound And the Lord shall descend, Even so&rsquo;-- it is well with my soul.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It is well-- with my soul. It is well, it is well with my soul.</p>
