    <h1>In My Heart</h1>
    <p class="verse">There&rsquo;s a melody of gladness that is ringing in my heart, Since I met the blessed Christ of Calvary; (of Calvary) It has silenced every sad refrain and made the joy-bells start, For he took away my sin and set me free. (He set me free)</p>
    <p class="chorus">In my heart a melody is ringing With a joy that never will depart; And angels song could not be sweeter Than the song that&rsquo;s in my heart.</p>
    <p class="verse">I remember how my longing heart was searching everywhere To discover what would take my guilt away; (my guilt away) Then I heard that Christ the Savior all my sins Himself did bear, And the spirit drew me to Him that glad day.( that happy day)</p>
    <p class="chorus">In my heart a melody is ringing With a joy that never will depart; And angels song could not be sweeter Than the song that&rsquo;s in my heart.</p>
    <p class="verse">O how dark and drear my pathway when I journeyed all Alone, With no friend divine to gently lead the way; (to lead the way) I&rsquo;m so glad that I met Jesus &ndash; that I claimed Him as my own, Now His love is growing sweeter every day. (yes every day)</p>
    <p class="chorus">In my heart a melody is ringing With a joy that never will depart; And angels song could not be sweeter Than the song that&rsquo;s in my heart.</p>
    <p class="verse">I am on my way to heaven where our joys will be complete In the bright eternal mansions we will share;( yes we will share) Face to face I&rsquo;ll see my Savior and I&rsquo;ll worship at His feet, I will sing His praise forever over there.( forever there)</p>
    <p class="chorus">In my heart a melody is ringing With a joy that never will depart; And angels song could not be sweeter Than the song that&rsquo;s in my heart.</p>
