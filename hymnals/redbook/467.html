    <h1>Since I Have Been Redeemed</h1>
    <p class="verse">I have a song I love to sing, Since I have been redeemed, Of my Redeemer, Savior, King-- Since I have been redeemed</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since I have been redeemed, Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in His name; Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in my Savior&rsquo;s name.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have a Christ that satisfies, Since I have been redeemed; To do His will my highest prize -- Since I have been redeemed</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since I have been redeemed, Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in His name; Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in my Savior&rsquo;s name.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have a witness bright and clear, Since I have been redeemed Dispelling ev&rsquo;ry doubt and fear -- Since I have been redeemed</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since I have been redeemed, Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in His name; Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in my Savior&rsquo;s name.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have a home prepared for me Since I have been redeemed, Where I shall dwell eternally -- Since I have been Redeem.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since I have been redeemed, Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in His name; Since I have been redeemed, I will glory in my Savior&rsquo;s name</p>
