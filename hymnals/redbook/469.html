    <h1>I&rsquo;ve Found A Friend</h1>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;ve found a Friend, O such a friend! He loved me ere I knew Him; He drew me with the cords of love, and thus He bound me to Him; And round my heart still closely twine those ties which naught can sever, For I am His, and He is mine, forever and forever.</p>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;ve found a Friend, O such a friend! He bled, He died to save me; And not alone the gift of life, but His own Self He gave me! Naught that I have mine own I call, I&rsquo;ll hold it for the Giver, My heart, my strength, my life, my all are His, and His forever.</p>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;ve found a Friend, O such a friend! All pow&rsquo;r to Him is given, To guard me on my onward course, and bring me safe to heaven. The eternal glories gleam afar, to nerve my faint endeavor; So now to watch, to work, to war, and then to rest forever.</p>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;ve found a Friend, O such a friend! So kind and true and tender, So wise a Counselor and Guide, so mighty a Defender! From Him who loves me now so well what power my soul can sever? Shall life or death, shall earth or hell? No! I am His forever.</p>
