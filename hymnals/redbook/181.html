    <h1>Onward, Christian Soldiers</h1>
    <p class="verse">Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, with the cross of Jesus going on before. Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe; forward into battle see his banner go!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, with the cross of Jesus going on before.</p>
    <p class="verse">At the sign of Triumph Satan's host doth flee; on then, Christian soldiers, on to victory! Hell's foundations quiver at the shout of praise; brothers, lift your voices, loud your anthems raise!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, with the cross of Jesus going on before.</p>
    <p class="verse">Like a mighty army moves the church of God; brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod. We are not divided, all one body we,-- one in hope and doctrine, one in charity.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, with the cross of Jesus going on before.</p>
    <p class="verse">Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng, blend with ours your voices in the Triumph song. Glory, laud, and honor unto Christ the King, this thru countless ages men and angels sing.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war, with the cross of Jesus going on before.</p>
