    <h1>Tell It To Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">Are you weary, are you heavy hearted? Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus. Are you grieving over joys departed? Tell it to Jesus alone.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus, He is a Friend that&rsquo;s well known. You&rsquo;ve no other such a friend or brother, Tell it to Jesus alone.</p>
    <p class="verse">Do the tears flow down your cheeks unbidden? Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus. Have you sins that to men&rsquo;s eyes are hidden? Tell it to Jesus alone.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus, He is a Friend that&rsquo;s well known. You&rsquo;ve no other such a friend or brother, Tell it to Jesus alone.</p>
    <p class="verse">Do you fear the gathering clouds of sorrow? Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus. Are you anxious what shall be tomorrow? Tell it to Jesus alone.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus, He is a Friend that&rsquo;s well known. You&rsquo;ve no other such a friend or brother, Tell it to Jesus alone.</p>
    <p class="verse">Are you troubled at the thought of dying? Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus. For Christ&rsquo;s coming kingdom are you sighing? Tell it to Jesus alone.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell it to Jesus, tell it to Jesus, He is a Friend that&rsquo;s well known. You&rsquo;ve no other such a friend or brother, Tell it to Jesus alone.</p>
