    <h1>I Know That My Redeemer Liveth</h1>
    <p class="verse">I know that my Redeemer liveth, And on the earth again shall stand; I know eternal life He giveth, That grace and power are in His hand.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I know, I know, that Jesus liveth, And on the earth again shall stand; I know, I know, that life He giveth, That grace and power are in His hand.</p>
    <p class="verse">I know His promise never faileth, The Word He speaks, it cannot die; Tho cruel death my flesh assaileth, Yet I shall see Him by and by.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I know, I know, that Jesus liveth, And on the earth again shall stand; I know, I know, that life He giveth, That grace and power are in His hand.</p>
    <p class="verse">I know my mansion He prepareth, That where He is there I may be; O wondrous tho&rsquo;t, for me He careth, And He at last will come for me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I know, I know, that Jesus liveth, And on the earth again shall stand; I know, I know, that life He giveth, That grace and power are in His hand.</p>
