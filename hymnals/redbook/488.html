    <h1>My Redeemer</h1>
    <p class="verse">I will sing of my Redeemer And His wondrous love to me; On the cruel cross He suffered, From the curse to set me free.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sing, O sing of my Redeemer, With His blood He purchased me; On the cross He sealed my pardon, Paid the debt and made me free!</p>
    <p class="verse">I will tell the wondrous story, How, my lost estate to save, In His boundless love and mercy, He the ransom freely gave.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sing, O sing of my Redeemer, With His blood He purchased me; On the cross He sealed my pardon, Paid the debt and made me free!</p>
    <p class="verse">I will praise my dear Redeemer, His triumphant pow&rsquo;r I&rsquo;ll tell, How the victory He giveth Over sin and death and hell.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sing, O sing of my Redeemer, With His blood He purchased me; On the cross He sealed my pardon, Paid the debt and made me free!</p>
    <p class="verse">I will sing of my Redeemer And His heav&rsquo;nly love to me; He from death to life hath bro&rsquo;t me, Son of God with Him to be.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sing, O sing of my Redeemer, With His blood He purchased me; On the cross He sealed my pardon, Paid the debt and made me free!</p>
