    <h1>Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">O soul, are you weary and troubled? No light in the darkness you see? There&rsquo;s light for a look at the Savior, And life more abundant and free!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">Thru death into life everlasting He passed, and we follow Him there; O&rsquo;er us sin no more hath dominion&mdash;For more than conquerors we are!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">His Word shall not fail you He promised; Believe Him, and all will be well: Then go to a world that is dying, His perfect salvation to tell!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Turn your eyes upon Jesus, Look full in His wonderful face, And the things of earth will grow strangely dim, In the light of His glory and grace.</p>
