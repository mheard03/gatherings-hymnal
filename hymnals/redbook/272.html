    <h1>The Solid Rock</h1>
    <p class="verse">My hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus&rsquo; blood and righteousness; I dare not trust the sweetest frame, But wholly lean on Jesus&rsquo; name.</p>
    <p class="chorus">On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other ground is sinking sand, All other ground is sinking sand.</p>
    <p class="verse">When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace; In every high and stormy gale, My anchor holds within the veil.</p>
    <p class="chorus">On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other ground is sinking sand, All other ground is sinking sand.</p>
    <p class="verse">His oath, His covenant, His blood Support me in the whelming flood; When all around my soul gives way, He then is all my hope and stay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other ground is sinking sand, All other ground is sinking sand.</p>
    <p class="verse">When He shall come with trumpet sound, Oh, may I then in Him be found; Dressed in His righteousness alone, Faultless to stand before the throne.</p>
    <p class="chorus">On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand; All other ground is sinking sand, All other ground is sinking sand.</p>
