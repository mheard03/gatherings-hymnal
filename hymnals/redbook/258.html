    <h1>He Hideth My Soul</h1>
    <p class="verse">A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, A wonderful Savior to me; He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock, Where rivers of pleasure I see.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock That shadows a dry, thirsty land; He hideth my life with the depths of His love, And covers me there with His hand, And covers me there with His hand.</p>
    <p class="verse">A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord, He taketh my burden away; He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved, He giveth me strength as my day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock That shadows a dry, thirsty land; He hideth my life with the depths of His love, And covers me there with His hand, And covers me there with His hand</p>
    <p class="verse">With numberless blessings each moment He crowns, And filled with His fullness divine, I sing in my rapture, &ldquo;O, glory to God For such a Redeemer as mine!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock That shadows a dry, thirsty land; He hideth my life with the depths of His love, And covers me there with His hand, And covers me there with His hand</p>
    <p class="verse">When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise To meet Him in clouds of the sky, His perfect salvation, His wonderful love I&rsquo;ll shout with the millions on high.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock That shadows a dry, thirsty land; He hideth my life with the depths of His love, And covers me there with His hand, And covers me there with His hand</p>
