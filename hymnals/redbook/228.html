    <h1>My Faith Has Found a Resting Place</h1>
    <p class="verse">My faith has found a resting place, Not in device nor creed; I trust the Everliving One, His wounds for me shall plead.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I need no other argument, I need no other plea; It is enough that Jesus died, And that He died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Enough for me that Jesus saves, This ends my fear and doubt; A sinful soul I come to Him, He'll never cast me out.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I need no other argument, I need no other plea; It is enough that Jesus died, And that He died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">My heart is leaning on the Word, The written Word of God Salvation by my Savior's name-- Salvation through His blood.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I need no other argument, I need no other plea; It is enough that Jesus died, And that He died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">My great Physician heals the sick, The lost He came to save; For me His precious blood He shed, For me His life He gave.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I need no other argument, I need no other plea; It is enough that Jesus died, And that He died for me.</p>
