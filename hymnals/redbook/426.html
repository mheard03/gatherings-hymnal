    <h1>Throw Out the Life-Line</h1>
    <p class="verse">Throw out the life line across the dark wave; There is a brother whom someone should save; Somebody&rsquo;s brother! O who then will dare To throw out the life line, his peril to share?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line! Someone is drifting away; Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line! Someone is sinking today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Throw out the life line with hand quick and strong: Why do you tarry, why linger so long? See! he is sinking; O, hasten today And out with the life boat! away, then away!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line! Someone is drifting away; Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line! Someone is sinking today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Throw out the life line to danger fraught men, Sinking in anguish where you&rsquo;ve never been; Winds of temptation and billows of woe Will soon hurl them out where the dark waters flow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line! Someone is drifting away; Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line! Someone is sinking today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Soon will the season of rescue be o&rsquo;er, Soon will they drift to eternity&rsquo;s shore; Haste, then, my brother, no time for delay, But throw out the life line and save them today.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line! Someone is drifting away; Throw out the life line! Throw out the life line! Someone is sinking today.</p>
