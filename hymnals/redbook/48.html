    <h1>His Matchless Worth</h1>
    <p class="verse">Oh could I speak the matchless worth, Oh could I sound the glories forth, Which in my Saviour shine. I&rsquo;d soar, and touch the heavenly strings And vie with Gabriel while he sings In notes almost divine. In notes almost divine.</p>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;d sing the precious blood He spilt, My ransom from the dreadful guilt of sin, and wrath divine! I&rsquo;d sing His glorious righteousness, in which all perfect, heavenly dress My soul shall ever shine, my soul shall ever shine.</p>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;d sing the characters He bears And all the forms of love He wears, exalted on His throne; In loftiest songs of sweetest praise, I would to everlasting days Make all His glories known, make all His glories known. Make all His glories known.</p>
    <p class="verse">Well, the delightful day will come When my dear Lord will bring me home, and I shall see His face; Then with my Savior, Brother, Friend, a blest eternity I&rsquo;ll spend, Triumphant in His grace, triumphant in His grace.</p>
