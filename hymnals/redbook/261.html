    <h1>Trust and Obey</h1>
    <p class="verse">When we walk with the Lord In the light of His Word, What a glory He sheds on our way! While we do His good will He abides with us still, And with all who will trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Trust and obey, For there&rsquo;s no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="verse">Not a shadow can rise; Not a cloud in the skies, But His smile quickly drives it away; Not a doubt nor a fear, Not a sigh nor a tear, Can abide while we trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Trust and obey, For there&rsquo;s no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="verse">Not a burden we bear, Not a sorrow we share, But our toil He doth richly repay; Not a grief nor a loss, Not a frown nor a cross, But is blest if we trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Trust and obey, For there&rsquo;s no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="verse">But we never can prove The delights of His love Until all on the altar we lay; For the favor He shows And the joy He bestows Are for them who will trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Trust and obey, For there&rsquo;s no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then in fellowship sweet We will sit at His feet, Or we`ll walk by His side in the way; What He says we will do, Where He sends we will go- Never fear only trust and obey.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Trust and obey, For there&rsquo;s no other way To be happy in Jesus, But to trust and obey.</p>
