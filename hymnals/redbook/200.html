    <h1>My Sins Are Blotted Out I Know</h1>
    <p class="verse">What a wondrous message in God's Word! My sins are blotted out, I know! If I trust in His re-deeming blood, My sins are blotted out, I know!</p>
    <p class="chorus">My sins are blotted out, I know! My sins are blotted out, I know! They are buried in the depths of the deepest sea: My sins are blotted out, I know!</p>
    <p class="verse">Once my heart was black, but now what joy; My sins are blotted out, I know! I have peace that nothing can destroy; My sins are blotted out, I know!</p>
    <p class="chorus">My sins are blotted out, I know! My sins are blotted out, I know! They are buried in the depths of the deepest sea: My sins are blotted out, I know!</p>
    <p class="verse">I shall stand some day before my King; My sins are blotted out, I know! With the ransomed host I then shall sing: &quot;My sins are blotted out, I know!&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">My sins are blotted out, I know! My sins are blotted out, I know! They are buried in the depths of the deepest sea: My sins are blotted out, I know!</p>
