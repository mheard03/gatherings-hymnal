    <h1>Jesus Is All the World To</h1>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is all the world to me, my life, my joy, my all; He is my strength from day to day, without him I would fall. When I am sad, to him I go, no other one can cheer me so; when I am sad, He makes me glad, He's my friend.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is all the world to me, my friend in trials sore; I go to Him for blessings, and He gives them o'er and o'er. He sends the sunshine and the rain, He sends the harvest's golden grain; sunshine and rain, harvest of grain, He's my friend.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is all the world to me, and true to Him I'll be; O how could I this Friend deny, when He's so true to me? Following Him I know I'm right, He watches o'er me day and night; following Him by day and night, He's my friend.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is all the world to me, I want no better friend; I trust him now, I'll trust Him when life's fleeting days shall end. Beautiful life with such a friend, beautiful life that has no end; eternal life, eternal joy, He's my friend.</p>
