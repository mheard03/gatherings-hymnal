    <h1>I Will Praise Him</h1>
    <p class="verse">When I saw the cleansing fountain Open wide for all my sin, I obeyed the Spirit&rsquo;s wooing, When He said, &ldquo;Wilt thou be clean?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will praise Him! I will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain.</p>
    <p class="verse">Though the way seems straight and narrow, All I claimed was swept away; My ambitions, plans and wishes, At my feet in ashes lay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will praise Him! I will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then God&rsquo;s fire upon the altar Of my heart was set a-flame; I shall never cease to praise Him Glory, glory to His Name!</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will praise Him! I will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain.</p>
    <p class="verse">Bless&egrave;d be the Name of Jesus! I&rsquo;m so glad He took me in; He&rsquo;s forgiven my transgressions; He has cleansed my heart from sin.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will praise Him! I will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain.</p>
    <p class="verse">Glory, glory to the Father! Glory, glory to the Son! Glory, glory to the Spirit! Glory to the Three in One!</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will praise Him! I will praise Him! Praise the Lamb for sinners slain; Give Him glory, all ye people, For His blood can wash away each stain.</p>
