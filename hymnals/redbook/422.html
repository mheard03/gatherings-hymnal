    <h1>Anywhere With Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go, Anywhere He leads me in this world below. Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade; Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know. Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.</p>
    <p class="verse">Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone, Other friends may fail me, He is still my own. Tho His hand may lead me over dreary ways, Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know. Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.</p>
    <p class="verse">Anywhere with Jesus over land and sea, Telling souls in darkness of salvation free; Ready as He summons me to go or stay, Anywhere with Jesus when He points the way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know. Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.</p>
    <p class="verse">Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep, When the darkling shadows round about me creep Knowing I shall waken never more to roam, Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know. Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.</p>
