    <h1>Christ is Risen from the Dead</h1>
    <p class="verse">Christ is risen from the dead He s risen as He said! Never, since the heavens rang With the song the angels sang On the morning of His birth, Had such gladness come to earth; Quickly were the tidings spread; Christ is risen from the dead!</p>
    <p class="verse">Gone the garden agony, Dreadful death of Calvary, Gone the hours of hopeless gloom While He lingered in the tomb; Like the waking, did it seem, From a terrifying dream &ndash; Now what rapt&rsquo;rous joy instead: Christ is risen from the dead.</p>
    <p class="verse">Christian brothers, shout and sing &ndash; Death has lost its ancient sting! Christ the crucified before, Is alive forever-more! Grave, where is thy victory now? See the light upon His brow! Empty, see, the stony bed: Christ is risen from the dead!</p>
    <p class="verse">Heirs of glory, thru His grace, Tears be dried from every face! Be your hearts no longer sad, On the Easter day be glad! Faith and hope are not in vain You are born to live again! Every soul be comforted; Christ is risen from the dead!</p>
