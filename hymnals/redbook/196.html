    <h1>Blessed be the Fountain</h1>
    <p class="verse">Blessed be the fountain of blood, To a world of sinners revealed; Blessed be the dear Son of God; Only by His stripes we are healed. Tho I&rsquo;ve wandered far from His fold, Bringing to my heart pain and woe, Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow, Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">Thorny was the crown that He wore, And the cross His body overcame; Grievous were the sorrows He bore, But He suffered Thus not in vain. May I to that fountain be led, Made to cleanse my sins here below; Wash me in the blood that He shed, And I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow, Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">Father, I have wandered from Thee, Often has my heart gone astray; Crimson do my sins seem to me, Water cannot wash them away. Jesus, to the fountain of Thine, Leaning on Thy promise, I go; Cleanse me by Thy washing divine, And I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Whiter than the snow, Whiter than the snow, Wash me in the blood of the Lamb, And I shall be whiter than snow.</p>
