    <h1>Hallelujah Tis Done</h1>
    <p class="verse">Tis the promise of God, full salvation to give Unto him who on Jesus, His Son, will believe.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah, tis done! I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah, tis done! I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tho the pathway be lonely, and dangerous, too, Surely Jesus is able to carry me through.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah, tis done! I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah, tis done! I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.</p>
    <p class="verse">Many loved ones have I in yon heavenly throng, They are safe now in glory, and this is their song.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah, tis done! I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah, tis done! I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.</p>
    <p class="verse">There is a part in that chorus for you and for me, And the theme of our praises forever will be.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah, tis done! I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One. Hallelujah, tis done! I believe on the Son; I am saved by the blood of the crucified One.</p>
