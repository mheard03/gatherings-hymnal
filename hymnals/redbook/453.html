    <h1>He Keeps Me Singing</h1>
    <p class="verse">There&rsquo;s within my heart a melody Jesus whispers sweet and low, &ldquo;Fear not, I am with thee,-- peace, be still&rdquo;, In all of life&rsquo;s ebb and flow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Sweetest Name I know, Fills my every longing, Keeps me singing as I go.</p>
    <p class="verse">All my life was wrecked by sin and strife, Discord filled my heart with pain, Jesus swept across the broken strings, Stirred the slumb&rsquo;ring chords again.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Sweetest Name I know, Fills my every longing, Keeps me singing as I go.</p>
    <p class="verse">Feasting on the riches of His grace, Resting &rsquo;neath His sheltering wing, Always looking on His smiling face,-- That is why I shout and sing.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Sweetest Name I know, Fills my every longing, Keeps me singing as I go.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tho sometimes He leads through waters deep, Trials fall across the way, Tho sometimes the path seems rough and steep, See His footprints all the way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Sweetest Name I know, Fills my every longing, Keeps me singing as I go.</p>
    <p class="verse">Soon He&rsquo;s coming back to welcome me, Far beyond the starry sky; I shall wing my flight to worlds unknown, I shall reign with Him on high.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Sweetest Name I know, Fills my every longing, Keeps me singing as I go.</p>
