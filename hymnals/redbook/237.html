    <h1>Why do You Wait</h1>
    <p class="verse">Why do you wait, dear brother, O why do you tarry so long? Your Savior is waiting to give you A place in His sanctified throng.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now? Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now?</p>
    <p class="verse">What do you hope, dear brother, To gain by a further delay? There&rsquo;s no one to save you but Jesus, There&rsquo;s no other way but His way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now? Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now?</p>
    <p class="verse">Do you not feel, dear brother, His Spirit now striving within? O why not accept His salvation, And throw off your burden of sin?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now? Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now?</p>
    <p class="verse">Why do your wait, dear brother? The harvest is passing away, Your Savior is longing to bless you, There&rsquo;s danger and death in delay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now? Why not? Why not? Why not come to Him now?</p>
