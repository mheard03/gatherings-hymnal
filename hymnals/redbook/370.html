    <h1>Count Your Blessings</h1>
    <p class="verse">When upon life&rsquo;s billows you are tempest tossed, When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost, Count your many blessings &mdash; name them one by one, And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Count your blessings &mdash; name them one by one; Count your blessings see what God hath done; Count your blessings &mdash; name them one by one; Count your many blessings &mdash; see what God has done.</p>
    <p class="verse">Are you ever burdened with a load of care? Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear? Count your many blessings &mdash; ev&rsquo;ry doubt will fly, And you will be singing as the days go by.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Count your blessings &mdash; name them one by one; Count your blessings see what God hath done; Count your blessings &mdash; name them one by one; Count your many blessings &mdash; see what God has done</p>
    <p class="verse">When you look at others with their lands and gold, Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold; Count your many blessings &mdash; money cannot buy Your reward in heaven nor your home on high.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Count your blessings &mdash; name them one by one; Count your blessings see what God hath done; Count your blessings &mdash; name them one by one; Count your many blessings &mdash; see what God has done</p>
    <p class="verse">So amid the conflict, whether great or small Do not be discouraged &mdash; God is over all; Count your many blessings &mdash; angels will attend, Help and comfort give you to your journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Count your blessings &mdash; name them one by one; Count your blessings see what God hath done; Count your blessings &mdash; name them one by one; Count your many blessings &mdash; see what God has done</p>
