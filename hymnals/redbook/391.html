    <h1>A Flag to Follow</h1>
    <p class="verse">I sought a flag to follow, a cause for which to stand, I sought a valiant leader, Who could my love command; I sought a stirring challenge, Some noble work to try, To give my life fulfillment, my dreams to satisfy.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I found them all in Jesus, the Life, the Truth, the Way; Beneath His flag I'll take my stand and follow Him today!</p>
    <p class="verse">I sought a ringing answer for all my doubts inside, A torch of truth uplifted, My searching steps to guide; I sought a word of wisdom, A true authority, I sought to know life's purpose, to solve its mystery.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I found them all in Jesus, the Life, the Truth, the Way; Beneath His flag I'll take my stand and follow Him today!</p>
    <p class="verse">I sought for satisfaction, for yearnings deep within, I sought for full deliverance, from chains of guilt and sin; I sought for peace and pardon, for freedom from my fears, I sought a hope to cling to beyond these passing years.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I found them all in Jesus, the Life, the Truth, the Way; Beneath His flag I'll take my stand and follow Him today!</p>
