    <h1>Grace Greater Than Our Sin</h1>
    <p class="verse">Marvelous grace of our loving Lord, grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt! Yonder on Calvary's mount outpoured, there where the blood of the Lamb was spilt.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that will pardon and cleanse within; grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin!</p>
    <p class="verse">Sin and despair, like the sea waves cold, threaten the soul with infinite loss; grace that is greater, yes, grace untold, points to the Refuge, the mighty cross.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that will pardon and cleanse within; grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin!</p>
    <p class="verse">Dark is the stain that we cannot hide. What can avail to wash it away? Look! There is flowing a crimson tide-- Whiter than snow you may be today.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that will pardon and cleanse within; grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin!</p>
    <p class="verse">Marvelous, infinite, matchless grace, freely bestowed on all who believe! You that are longing to see his face, Will you this moment his grace receive?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that will pardon and cleanse within; grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin!</p>
