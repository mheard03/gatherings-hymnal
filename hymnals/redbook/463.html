    <h1>All That Thrills My Soul</h1>
    <p class="verse">Who can cheer the heart like Jesus, By His presence all divine? True and tender, pure and precious, O how blest to call Him mine!</p>
    <p class="chorus">All that thrills my soul is Jesus, He is more than life to me; And the fairest of ten thousand In my blessed Lord I see.</p>
    <p class="verse">Love of Christ so freely given, Grace of God beyond degree, Mercy higher than the heaven, Deeper than the deepest sea!</p>
    <p class="chorus">All that thrills my soul is Jesus, He is more than life to me; And the fairest of ten thousand In my blessed Lord I see</p>
    <p class="verse">What a wonderful redemption! Never can a mortal know How my sin, tho red like crimson, Can be whiter than the snow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">All that thrills my soul is Jesus, He is more than life to me; And the fairest of ten thousand In my blessed Lord I see</p>
    <p class="verse">Every need His hand supplying, Every good in Him I see; On His strength divine relying, He is all in all to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">All that thrills my soul is Jesus, He is more than life to me; And the fairest of ten thousand In my blessed Lord I see</p>
    <p class="verse">By the crystal flowing river With the ransomed I will sing, And forever and forever Praise and glorify the King.</p>
    <p class="chorus">All that thrills my soul is Jesus, He is more than life to me; And the fairest of ten thousand In my blessed Lord I see</p>
