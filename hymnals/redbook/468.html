    <h1>I Will Sing the Wondourous Story</h1>
    <p class="verse">I will sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me; How He left His home in glory For the cross of Calvary.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yes, I&rsquo;ll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me, Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.</p>
    <p class="verse">I was lost, but Jesus found me, Found the sheep that went astray, Threw His loving arms around me, Drew me back into His way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yes, I&rsquo;ll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me, Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.</p>
    <p class="verse">I was bruised, but Jesus healed me, Faint was I from many a fall, Sight was gone, and fears possessed me, But He freed me from them all.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yes, I&rsquo;ll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me, Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.</p>
    <p class="verse">Days of darkness still come o&rsquo;er me, Sorrow&rsquo;s path I often tread, But the Savior still is with me; By His hand I&rsquo;m safely led.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yes, I&rsquo;ll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me, Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.</p>
    <p class="verse">He will keep me till the river Rolls its waters at my feet; Then He&rsquo;ll bear me safely over, Where the loved ones I shall meet.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yes, I&rsquo;ll sing the wondrous story Of the Christ Who died for me, Sing it with the saints in glory, Gathered by the crystal sea.</p>
