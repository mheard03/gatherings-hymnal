    <h1>Still Sweeter Every Day</h1>
    <p class="verse">To Jesus ev&rsquo;ry day I find my heart is closer drawn, He's fairer than the glory of the gold and purple dawn; He&rsquo;s all my fancy pictures in its fairest dreams, and more. Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The half cannot be fancied this side the golden shore; O there He&rsquo;ll be still sweeter than He ever was before</p>
    <p class="verse">His glory broke upon me when I saw Him from afar He&rsquo;s fairer than the lily brighter than the morning star. He fills and satisfies my longing spirit o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er-- Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The half cannot be fancied on this side the golden shore; O there He&rsquo;ll be still sweeter than He ever was before</p>
    <p class="verse">My heart is sometimes heavy but He comes with sweet relief, He folds me to His bosom when I droop with blighting grief; I love the Christ who all my burdens in His body bore--Each day He grows still sweeter than He was the day before.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The half cannot be fancied on this side the golden shore; O there He&rsquo;ll be still sweeter than He ever was before</p>
