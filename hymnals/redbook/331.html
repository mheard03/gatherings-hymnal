    <h1>Make Me a Channel of Blessing</h1>
    <p class="verse">Is your life a channel of blessing? Is the love of God flowing through you? Are you telling the lost of the Savior? Are you ready His service to do?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Make me a channel of blessing today, Make me a channel of blessing, I pray; My life possessing, my service blessing, Make me a channel of blessing today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Is your life a channel of blessing? Are you burdened for those that are lost? Have you urged upon those who are straying The Savior Who died on the cross?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Make me a channel of blessing today, Make me a channel of blessing, I pray; My life possessing, my service blessing, Make me a channel of blessing today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Is your life a channel of blessing? Is it a daily telling for Him? Have you spoken the Word of salvation To those who are dying in sin?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Make me a channel of blessing today, Make me a channel of blessing, I pray; My life possessing, my service blessing, Make me a channel of blessing today.</p>
    <p class="verse">We cannot be channels of blessing If our lives are not free from known sin; We will barriers be and a hindrance To those we are trying to win.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Make me a channel of blessing today, Make me a channel of blessing, I pray; My life possessing, my service blessing, Make me a channel of blessing today.</p>
