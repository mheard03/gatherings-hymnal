    <h1>Satisfied</h1>
    <p class="verse">All my life long I had a panted For a draught from some clear spring, That I hoped would quench the burning Of the thirst I felt within.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah! I have found Him Whom my soul so long has craved! Jesus satisfies my longings - Thru His blood I now am saved.</p>
    <p class="verse">Feeding on the husks around me, Till my strength was almost gone, Longed my soul for something better, Only still to hunger on.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah! I have found Him Whom my soul so long has craved! Jesus satisfies my longings - Thru His blood I now am saved.</p>
    <p class="verse">Poor I was, and sought for riches, Something that would satisfy, But the dust I gathered round me Only mocked my soul's sad cry.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah! I have found Him Whom my soul so long has craved! Jesus satisfies my longings - Thru His blood I now am saved.</p>
    <p class="verse">Well of water, ever springing, Bread of life so rich and free, Untold wealth that never faileth, My Redeemer is to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah! I have found Him Whom my soul so long has craved! Jesus satisfies my longings - Thru His blood I now am saved.</p>
