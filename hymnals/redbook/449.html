    <h1>To God Be the Glory</h1>
    <p class="verse">To God be the glory--great things He hath done! So loved He the world that He gave us His Son Who yielded His life an atonement for sin and opened the Life-gate that all may go in.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! 0 come to the Father thru Jesus the Son, and give Him the glory -- great things he hath done!</p>
    <p class="verse">O perfect redemption, The purchase of blood! To every believer the promise of God; The vilest offender who truly believes, That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! 0 come to the Father thru Jesus the Son, and give Him the glory -- great things he hath done!</p>
    <p class="verse">Great things He hath taught us, Great things He hath done, And great our rejoicing thru Jesus the Son; But purer and higher and greater will be Our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, Let the earth hear His voice! Praise the Lord, Praise the Lord, Let the people rejoice! 0 come to the Father thru Jesus the Son, and give Him the glory - great things he hath done!</p>
