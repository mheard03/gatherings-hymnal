    <h1>Brethren, We Have Met to Worship</h1>
    <p class="verse">Brethren, we have met to worship and adore the Lord our God; Will you pray with all your power, while we try to preach the Word? All is vain unless the Spirit of the Holy One comes down; Brethren, pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.</p>
    <p class="verse">Brethren, see poor sinners round you slumbering on the brink of woe; Death is coming, hell is moving, can you bear to let them go? See our fathers and our mothers, and our children sinking down; Brethren, pray and holy manna will be showered all around.</p>
    <p class="verse">Sisters, will you join and help us? Moses' sister aided him; Will you help the trembling mourners who are struggling hard with sin? Tell them all about the Savior, tell them that He will be found; Sisters, pray, and holy manna will be showered all around.</p>
    <p class="verse">Let us love our God supremely, let us love each other, too; Let us love and pray for sinners, till our God makes all things new. Then He'll call us home to Heaven, at His table we'll sit down; Christ will gird Himself and serve us with sweet manna all around.</p>
