    <h1>Opened for Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">There is a Fountain opened for my cleansing, Where sin&rsquo;s atonement by my Lord was made; He was the Lamb that was led to the slaughter, His blood the fountain where my debt was paid.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Opened for me, Opened for me, The precious, cleansing Fount was opened there for me</p>
    <p class="verse">There is a Rock that stands, by storms unshaken, Redemption&rsquo;s Author the foundation laid; By faith my stand on His righteousness I&rsquo;ve taken, He will not fail I shall not be dismayed.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Opened for me, Opened for me, The precious, cleansing Fount was opened there for me</p>
    <p class="verse">There is a Book that points the path to glory, Eternal guidepost for the wayward soul; On its fair pages is told the wondrous story Of life in Christ, the everlasting goal.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Opened for me, Opened for me, The precious, cleansing Fount was opened there for me</p>
    <p class="verse">There is a Hope, a wondrous consolation, In a benighted world a constant star; These eyes now dulled by the shadows that surround meMy Savior shall behold realms afar.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Opened for me, Opened for me, The precious, cleansing Fount was opened there for me</p>
    <p class="verse">There is a Home my Savior is preparing I may not need to cross death&rsquo;s sullen vale; Soon from earth&rsquo;s bondage His coming will release me To live where joys eternal shall prevail.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Opened for me, Opened for me, The precious, cleansing Fount was opened there for me</p>
