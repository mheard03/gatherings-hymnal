    <h1>Give of Your Best to Your Master</h1>
    <p class="verse">Give of your best to the Master; Give of the strength of your youth; throw your soul&rsquo;s fresh, glowing ardor Into the battle for truth. Jesus has set the example, Dauntless was He, young and brave; Give Him your loyal devotion; Give Him the best that you have.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Give of your best to the Master; Give of the strength of your youth; Clad in salvation&rsquo;s full armor, Join in the battle for truth.</p>
    <p class="verse">Give of your best to the Master; Give Him first place in your heart; Give Him first place in your service; Consecrate every part. Give, and to you shall be given God His beloved Son gave; Gratefully seeking to serve Him, Give Him the best that you have.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Give of your best to the Master; Give of the strength of your youth; Clad in salvation&rsquo;s full armor, Join in the battle for truth.</p>
    <p class="verse">Give of your best to the Master; Nought else is worthy His love; He gave Himself for your ransom Gave up His glory above. Laid down His life without murmur, You from sin&rsquo;s ruin to save; Give Him your heart&rsquo;s adoration; Give Him the best that you have.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Give of your best to the Master; Give of the strength of your youth; Clad in salvation&rsquo;s full armor, Join in the battle for truth.</p>
