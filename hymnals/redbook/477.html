    <h1>At Calvary</h1>
    <p class="verse">Years I spent in vanity and pride, Caring not my Lord was crucified, Knowing not it was for me He died on Calvary.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.</p>
    <p class="verse">By God&rsquo;s Word at last my sin I learned; Then I trembled at the law I&rsquo;d spurned, Till my guilty soul imploring turned to Calvary.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.</p>
    <p class="verse">Now I&rsquo;ve given to Jesus everything, Now I gladly own Him as my King, Now my raptured soul can only sing of Calvary!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.</p>
    <p class="verse">Oh, the love that drew salvation&rsquo;s plan! Oh, the grace that brought it down to man! Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span at Calvary!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Mercy there was great, and grace was free; Pardon there was multiplied to me; There my burdened soul found liberty at Calvary.</p>
