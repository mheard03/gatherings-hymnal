    <h1>It&rsquo;s Just Like His Great Love</h1>
    <p class="verse">A friend I have called Jesus, Whose love is strong and true, And never fails how-e&rsquo;er &rsquo;tis tried, no matter what I do; I&rsquo;ve sinned against this love of His, but when I knelt to pray, Confessing all my guilt to Him, the sin clouds rolled away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It&rsquo;s just like Jesus to roll the clouds away, it&rsquo;s just like Jesus to keep me day by day, it&rsquo;s just like Jesus all along the way, It&rsquo;s just like His great love.</p>
    <p class="verse">Sometimes the clouds of trouble bedim the sky above, I cannot see my Savior&rsquo;s face, I doubt His wondrous love; But He, from heaven&rsquo;s mercy seat, beholding my despair, In pity bursts the clouds between, and shows me He is there.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It&rsquo;s just like Jesus to roll the clouds away, it&rsquo;s just like Jesus to keep me day by day, it&rsquo;s just like Jesus all along the way, It&rsquo;s just like His great love.</p>
    <p class="verse">When sorrow&rsquo;s clouds o&rsquo;ertake me, and break upon my head, When life seems worse than useless, and I were better dead; I take my grief to Jesus then, nor do I go in vain, For heavenly hope He gives that cheers like sunshine after rain.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It&rsquo;s just like Jesus to roll the clouds away, it&rsquo;s just like Jesus to keep me day by day, it&rsquo;s just like Jesus all along the way, It&rsquo;s just like His great love.</p>
    <p class="verse">O, I could sing forever of Jesus&rsquo; love divine, Of all His care and tenderness for this poor life of mine; His love is in and over all, and wind and waves obey, When Jesus whispers &ldquo;Peace, be still!&rdquo; and rolls the clouds away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It&rsquo;s just like Jesus to roll the clouds away, it&rsquo;s just like Jesus to keep me day by day, it&rsquo;s just like Jesus all along the way, It&rsquo;s just like His great love.</p>
