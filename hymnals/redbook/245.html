    <h1>I am Praying For You</h1>
    <p class="verse">I have a Savior, He&rsquo;s pleading in glory, A dear, loving Savior, tho earth-friends be few; And now He is watching in tenderness o&rsquo;er me; But, oh, that my Savior were your Savior, too.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For you I am praying, For you I am praying, For you I am praying, I&rsquo;m praying for you.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have a Father; to me He has Given a hope for eternity, blessed and true; And soon He will call me to meet Him in heaven, But, oh, that He&rsquo;d let me bring you with me, too!</p>
    <p class="chorus">For you I am praying, For you I am praying, For you I am praying, I&rsquo;m praying for you.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have a robe; &rsquo;tis resplendent in whiteness, Awaiting in glory my wondering view; O, when I receive it all shining in brightness, Dear friend, could I see you receiving one, too!</p>
    <p class="chorus">For you I am praying, For you I am praying, For you I am praying, I&rsquo;m praying for you.</p>
    <p class="verse">When Christ has found you, tell others the story, That my loving Savior is your Savior, too; Then pray that your Savior may bring them to glory, And prayer will be answered &mdash; &rsquo;twas answered for you!</p>
    <p class="chorus">For you I am praying, For you I am praying, For you I am praying, I&rsquo;m praying for you.</p>
