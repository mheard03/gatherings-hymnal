    <h1>He is So Precious To Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">So precious is Jesus, my Savior, my King; His praise all the day long with rapture I sing. To Him in my weakness for strength I can cling, For He is so precious to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For He is so precious to me, For He is so precious, to me. &rsquo;Tis heaven below, my Redeemer to know, For He is so precious to me.</p>
    <p class="verse">He stood at my heart&rsquo;s door &rsquo;mid sunshine and rain, And patiently waited an entrance to gain. What shame that so long He entreated in vain, For He is so precious to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For He is so precious to me, For He is so precious, to me. &rsquo;Tis heaven below, my Redeemer to know, For He is so precious to me.</p>
    <p class="verse">I stand on the mountain of blessing at last, No cloud in the heavens a shadow to cast, His smile is upon me; the valley is past, For He is so precious to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For He is so precious to me, For He is so precious, to me. &rsquo;Tis heaven below, my Redeemer to know, For He is so precious to me.</p>
    <p class="verse">I praise Him because He appointed a place Where some day, through faith in His wonderful grace, I know I shall see Him,-- shall look on His face, For He is so precious to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For He is so precious to me, For He is so precious, to me. &rsquo;Tis heaven below, my Redeemer to know, For He is so precious to me.</p>
