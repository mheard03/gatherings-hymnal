    <h1>Heaven Came Down and Filled My Soul</h1>
    <p class="verse">O what a wonderful, wonderful day - day I will never forget; After I'd wandered in darkness away, Jesus my Saviour I met. O what a tender, compassionate friend -- He met the need of my heart; Shadows dispelling, With joy I am telling, He made all the darkness depart.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Heaven came down and glory filled my soul, When at the cross the Saviour made me whole; My sins were washed away - And my night was turned to day &ndash;Heaven came down and glory filled my soul!</p>
    <p class="verse">Born of the Spirit with life from above into God's fam'ly divine, Justified fully thru Calvary's love, O what a standing is mine! And the transaction so quickly was made when as a sinner I came, Took of the offer of grace He did proffer - He saved me, O praise His dear name!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Heaven came down and glory filled my soul, When at the cross the Saviour made me whole; My sins were washed away - And my night was turned to day &ndash;Heaven came down and glory filled my soul!</p>
    <p class="verse">Now I've a hope that will surely endure after the passing of time; I have a future in heaven for sure, there in those mansions sublime. And it's because of that wonderful day when at the cross I believed; Riches eternal and blessings supernal from His precious hand I received.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Heaven came down and glory filled my soul, When at the cross the Saviour made me whole; My sins were washed away - And my night was turned to day &ndash;Heaven came down and glory filled my soul! &ndash;Heaven came down and glory filled my soul!</p>
