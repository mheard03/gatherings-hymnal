    <h1>Golden Harps are Sounding</h1>
    <p class="verse">Golden harps are sounding, Angel voices sing, Pearly gates are opened, opened for the King; Christ, the King of glory, Jesus, King of love, Is gone up in triumph, to His throne above.</p>
    <p class="chorus">All His suffering ended, joyfully we sing, Jesus hath ascended! Glory to our King!</p>
    <p class="verse">He Who came to save us, He Who bled and died, Now is crowned with glory at His Father&rsquo;s side. Nevermore to suffer, nevermore to die; Jesus King of glory, is gone up on high.</p>
    <p class="chorus">All His suffering ended, joyfully we sing, Jesus hath ascended! Glory to our King!</p>
    <p class="verse">Praying for His children in that blessed place, Calling them to glory, sending them His grace; His bright home preparing, faithful ones, for you; Jesus ever liveth, ever loveth, too.</p>
    <p class="chorus">All His suffering ended, joyfully we sing, Jesus hath ascended! Glory to our King!</p>
