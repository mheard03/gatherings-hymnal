    <h1>We&rsquo;re Marching to Zion</h1>
    <p class="verse">Come, we that love the Lord, and let our joys be known; join in a song with sweet accord, join in a song with sweet accord and thus surround the throne, and thus surround the throne.</p>
    <p class="chorus">We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion; we're marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God.</p>
    <p class="verse">Let those refuse to sing who never knew our God; but children of the heavenly King, but children of the heavenly King may speak their joys abroad, may speak their joys abroad.</p>
    <p class="chorus">We're marching to Zion,beautiful, beautiful Zion; we're marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God.</p>
    <p class="verse">The hill of Zion yields a thousand sacred sweets before we reach the heavenly fields, before we reach the heavenly fields, or walk the golden streets, or walk the golden streets.</p>
    <p class="chorus">We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion; we're marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then let our songs abound, and every tear be dry; we're marching through Immanuel's ground, we're marching through Immanuel's ground, to fairer worlds on high, to fairer worlds on high.</p>
    <p class="chorus">We're marching to Zion, beautiful, beautiful Zion; we're marching upward to Zion, the beautiful city of God.</p>
