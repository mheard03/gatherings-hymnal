    <h1>Under His Wings</h1>
    <p class="verse">Under His wings I am safely abiding, Tho the night deepens and tempests are wild, Still I can trust Him; I know He will keep me, He has redeemed me, and I am His child.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Under His wings, under His wings, Who from His love can sever? Under His wings my soul shall abide, Safely abide forever.</p>
    <p class="verse">Under His wings, what a refuge in sorrow! How the heart yearningly turns to His rest! Often when earth has no balm for my healing, There I find comfort, and there I am blessed.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Under His wings, under His wings, Who from His love can sever? Under His wings my soul shall abide, Safely abide forever.</p>
    <p class="verse">Under His wings, oh, what precious enjoyment! There will I hide till life&rsquo;s trials are o&rsquo;er; Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me, Resting in Jesus, I&rsquo;m safe evermore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Under His wings, under His wings, Who from His love can sever? Under His wings my soul shall abide, Safely abide forever.</p>
