    <h1>We Have An Anchor</h1>
    <p class="verse">Will your anchor hold in the storms of life, When the clouds unfold their wings of strife? When the strong tides lift and the cables strain, Will your anchor drift, or firm remain?</p>
    <p class="chorus">We have an anchor that keeps the soul Steadfast and sure while the billows roll, Fastened to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.</p>
    <p class="verse">It is safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand, For 'tis well secured by the Savior's hand; Tho the tempest rage and the wild winds blow, Not an angry wave shall our bark o&rsquo;er flow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">We have an anchor that keeps the soul Steadfast and sure while the billows roll, Fastened to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.</p>
    <p class="verse">When our eyes behold through the gath'ring night the city of gold, our harbor bright, We shall anchor fast by the heav'nly shore, With the storms all past for evermore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">We have an anchor that keeps the soul Steadfast and sure while the billows roll, Fastened to the Rock which cannot move, Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.</p>
