    <h1>Blessed Quietness</h1>
    <p class="verse">Joys are flowing like a river, since the Comforter has come He abides with us forever, makes the trusting heart His home.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Blessed quietness, holy quietness, what assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me, How the billows cease to roll!</p>
    <p class="verse">Bringing life and health and gladness all around this heavenly Guest, banished unbelief and sadness, changed our weariness to rest.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Blessed quietness, holy quietness, what assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me, How the billows cease to roll!</p>
    <p class="verse">Like the rain that falls from heaven, like the sunlight from the sky, so the Holy Ghost is given, coming on us from on high.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Blessed quietness, holy quietness, what assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me, How the billows cease to roll!</p>
    <p class="verse">See a fruitful field is growing, blessed fruit of righteousness; and the streams of life are flowing in the lonely wilderness.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Blessed quietness, holy quietness, what assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me, How the billows cease to roll!</p>
    <p class="verse">What a wonderful salvation, Where we always see His face! What perfect habitation, What a quiet resting place!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Blessed quietness, holy quietness, what assurance in my soul! On the stormy sea, He speaks peace to me, How the billows cease to roll!</p>
