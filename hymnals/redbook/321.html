    <h1>Nothing Between</h1>
    <p class="verse">Nothing between my soul and my Savior, naught of this world's delusive dream; I have renounced all sinful pleasure; Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Nothing between my soul and my Savior, so that his blessed face may be seen; nothing preventing the least of his favor; keep the way clear! Let nothing between.</p>
    <p class="verse">Nothing between, like worldly pleasure; habits of life, tho harmless they seem, must not my heart from him ever sever; he is my all, there's nothing between.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Nothing between my soul and my Savior, so that his blessed face may be seen; nothing preventing the least of his favor; keep the way clear! Let nothing between.</p>
    <p class="verse">Nothing between, like pride or station; self or friends shall not intervene; tho it may cost me much tribulation, I am resolved! there's nothing between.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Nothing between my soul and my Savior, so that his blessed face may be seen; nothing preventing the least of his favor; keep the way clear! Let nothing between.</p>
    <p class="verse">Nothing between, E'en many hard trials, tho the whole world against me convene; watching with prayer and much self-denial, triumph at last, there's nothing between.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Nothing between my soul and my Savior, so that his blessed face may be seen; nothing preventing the least of his favor; keep the way clear! Let nothing between.</p>
