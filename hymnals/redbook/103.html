    <h1>One Day!</h1>
    <p class="verse">One day when heaven was filled with His praises, One day when sin was as black as could be, Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin, Dwelt among men- my example is He!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living- He loved me, Dying- He saved me, Buried- He carried my sins far away; Rising- He justified freely, forever; One day He&rsquo;s coming- O Glorious day!</p>
    <p class="verse">One day they led Him up Calvary&rsquo;s mountain, One day they nailed Him to die on the tree; Suffering anguish, despised and rejected, Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living- He loved me, Dying- He saved me, Buried- He carried my sins far away; Rising- He justified freely, forever; One day He&rsquo;s coming- O Glorious day!</p>
    <p class="verse">One day they left Him alone in the garden, One day He rested, from suffering free; Angels came down o&lsquo;er His tomb to keep vigil- Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living- He loved me, Dying- He saved me, Buried- He carried my sins far away; Rising- He justified freely, forever; One day He&rsquo;s coming- O Glorious day!</p>
    <p class="verse">One day the grave could conceal Him no longer, One day the stone rolled away from the door; Then He arose, over death He had conquered, Now is ascended, my Lord evermore!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living- He loved me, Dying- He saved me, Buried- He carried my sins far away; Rising- He justified freely, forever; One day He&rsquo;s coming- O Glorious day!</p>
    <p class="verse">One day the trumpet will sound for His coming, One day the skies with His glory will shine; Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing! Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living- He loved me, Dying- He saved me, Buried- He carried my sins far away; Rising- He justified freely, forever; One day He&rsquo;s coming- O Glorious day!</p>
