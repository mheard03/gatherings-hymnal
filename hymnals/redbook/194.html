    <h1>Ye Must be Born Again</h1>
    <p class="verse">A ruler once came to Jesus by night To ask Him the way of salvation and light; The Master made answer in words true and plain, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">&ldquo;Ye must be born again, Ye must be born again&rdquo;, I verily, verily, say unto thee, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">Ye children of men, attend to the Word, So solemnly uttered by Jesus the Lord; And let not this message to you be in vain, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">&ldquo;Ye must be born again, Ye must be born again&rdquo;, I verily, verily, say unto thee, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">O ye who would enter that glorious rest, And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest, The life everlasting if ye would obtain, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">&ldquo;Ye must be born again, Ye must be born again&rdquo;, I verily, verily, say unto thee, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">A dear one in Heaven thy heart yearns to see, At the beautiful gate may be watching for thee, Then list to the note of this solemn refrain, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">&ldquo;Ye must be born again, Ye must be born again&rdquo;, I verily, verily, say unto thee, &ldquo;Ye must be born again.&rdquo;</p>
