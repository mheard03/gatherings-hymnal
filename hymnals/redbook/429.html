    <h1>Ready</h1>
    <p class="verse">Ready to suffer grief or pain, Ready to stand the test, ready to stay at home and send Others if He sees best.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Ready to go, ready to stay, Ready my place to fill, Ready for service, lowly or great, Ready to do His will.</p>
    <p class="verse">Ready to go, ready to bear, Ready to watch and pray, Ready to stand aside and give, Till He shall clear the way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Ready to go, ready to stay, Ready my place to fill, Ready for service, lowly or great, Ready to do His will.</p>
    <p class="verse">Ready to speak, ready to think, ready with heart and mind, Ready to stand where He sees fit, Ready His will to find.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Ready to go, ready to stay, Ready my place to fill, Ready for service, lowly or great, Ready to do His will.</p>
    <p class="verse">Ready to speak, ready to warn, ready o&rsquo;er souls to yearn, Ready in life, ready in death, Ready for His return.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Ready to go, ready to stay, Ready my place to fill, Ready for service, lowly or great, Ready to do His will.</p>
