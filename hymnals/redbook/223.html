    <h1>Arise, my Soul, Arise</h1>
    <p class="verse">Arise, my soul, arise shake off thy guilty fears; The bleeding sacrifice in my behalf appears: Before the throne my surety stands, My name is written on His hands. My name is written on His hands.</p>
    <p class="verse">He ever lives above, for me to intercede; His all redeeming love, His precious blood, to plead: His blood atoned for all our race, His blood atoned for all our race, And sprinkles now the throne of grace. And sprinkles now the throne of grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">Five bleeding wounds He bears; received on Calvary; They pour effectual prayers; they strongly plead for me: &ldquo;Forgive him, O forgive,&rdquo; they cry, &ldquo;Nor let that ransomed sinner die!&rdquo; &ldquo;Nor let that ransomed sinner die!&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">The Father hears Him pray, His dear anointed One; He cannot turn away, the presence of His Son; His Spirit answers to the blood, And tells me I am born of God. And tells me I am born of God.</p>
    <p class="verse">My God is Reconciled; His pardoning voice I hear; He owns me for His child; I can no longer fear: With confidence I now draw nigh, And &ldquo;Father, Abba, Father,&rdquo; cry. And &ldquo;Father, Abba, Father,&rdquo; cry.</p>
