    <h1>Jesus Paid it All</h1>
    <p class="verse">I hear the Savior say, &ldquo;Thy strength indeed is small; Child of weakness, watch and pray, Find in Me thine all in all.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">Lord, now indeed I find Thy power and Thine alone, Can change the leper&rsquo;s spots And melt the heart of stone.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">For nothing good have I Whereby Thy grace to claim - I&rsquo;ll wash my garments white In the blood of Calvary&rsquo;s Lamb.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">And when before the throne I stand in Him complete, &ldquo;Jesus died my soul to save&rdquo; My lips shall still repeat.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus paid it all, All to Him I owe; Sin had left a crimson stain, He washed it white as snow.</p>
