    <h1>O Worship the King</h1>
    <p class="verse">O worship the King, all glorious above, And gratefully sing His power and His love; Our Shield and Defender, the Ancient of Days, Pavilioned in splendor and girded with praise.</p>
    <p class="verse">O tell of His might, O sing of His grace, Whose robe is the light, whose canopy space; His chariots of wrath the deep thunder clouds form, And dark is His path on the wings of the storm.</p>
    <p class="verse">Thy bountiful care what tongue can recite? It breathes in the air, it shines in the light; It streams from the hills, it descends to the plain, And sweetly distills in the dew and the rain.</p>
    <p class="verse">Frail children of dust, and feeble as frail, In thee do we trust, not find thee to fail: They mercies how tender! How firm to the end! Our maker, Defender, Redeemer and Friend.</p>
