    <h1>I My Name Written There ?</h1>
    <p class="verse">Lord, I care not for riches, neither silver nor gold; I would make sure of Heaven, I would enter the fold. In the book of Thy kingdom, with its pages so fair, Tell me, Jesus, my Savior, is my name written there?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Is my name written there, On the page white and fair? In the book of Thy kingdom, Is my name written there?</p>
    <p class="verse">Lord, my sins they are many, like the sands of the sea, But Thy blood, O my Savior, is sufficient for me; For Thy promise is written, in bright letters that glow, &ldquo;Tho your sins be as scarlet, I will make them like snow.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Is my name written there, On the page white and fair? In the book of Thy kingdom, Is my name written there?</p>
    <p class="verse">O that beautiful city, with its mansions of light, With its glorified beings, in pure garments of white; Where no evil thing cometh to despoil what is fair; Where the angels are watching, yes, my name&rsquo;s written there.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Yes my name&rsquo;s written there, On the page white and fair? In the book of Thy kingdom, Yes my name written there?</p>
