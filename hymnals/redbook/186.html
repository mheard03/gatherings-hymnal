    <h1>The Church's One Foundation</h1>
    <p class="verse">The church's one foundation is Jesus Christ her Lord; she is his new creation by water and the Word. From heaven he came and sought her to be his holy bride; with his own blood he bought her and for her life he died.</p>
    <p class="verse">Elect from every nation, yet one o'er all the earth; her charter of salvation, one Lord, one faith, one birth; one holy name she blesses, partakes one holy food, and to one hope she presses, with every grace endued.</p>
    <p class="verse">Mid toil and tribulation, and tumult of her war, she waits the consummation of peace forever-more; till, with the vision glorious, her longing eyes are blest, and the great Church victorious shall be the Church at rest.</p>
    <p class="verse">Yet she on earth hath union with God the Three in One, and mystic sweet communion with those whose rest is won. O happy ones and holy! Lord, give us grace that we like them, the meek and lowly, on high may dwell with thee.</p>
