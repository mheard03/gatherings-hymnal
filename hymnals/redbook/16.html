    <h1>The Lord is King</h1>
    <p class="verse">The Lord is King! Lift up, lift up thy voice &ndash; sing His praise, sing His praise! All heaven and earth before Him now rejoice &ndash; Sing His praise, Sing His praise! From world to world the joy shall ring, For He alone is God and King; From sky to sky His banners fling &ndash; Sing His praise, sing His praise!</p>
    <p class="verse">The Lord is King! Let all His worth declare &ndash; Great is He, great is He! Bow to His will and trust His tender care &ndash; Great is He, great is He! Nor murmur at His wise decrees, Nor doubt His steadfast promises; In humble faith fall on thy knees &ndash; Great is He, great is He!</p>
    <p class="verse">The Lord is King! And bow to Him ye must &ndash; God is great, God is good! The judge of all to all is ever just &ndash; God is great, God is good! Holy and true are all His ways; Let every creature shout His praise; The Lord of Hosts, Ancient of Days &ndash; God is great, God is good!</p>
    <p class="verse">The Lord is King! Thru-out His vast domain He is all, all in all! The Lord Jehovah ever more shall reign &ndash; He is all, all in all! Thru earth and heaven one song shall ring, From grateful hearts this anthem spring; Arise, ye saints, salute thy King &ndash; All thy days, Sing His praise!</p>
