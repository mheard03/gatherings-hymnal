    <h1>I Heard The Voice Of Jesus Say</h1>
    <p class="verse">I heard the voice of Jesus say, &ldquo;Come unto Me and rest; Lay down, thou weary one, lay down Thy head upon My breast.&rdquo; I came to Jesus as I was Weary and worn and sad; I found in Him a resting place, and He has made me glad.</p>
    <p class="verse">I heard the voice of Jesus say, &ldquo;Behold, I freely give The living water; thirsty one, Stoop down, and drink, and live.&rdquo; I came to Jesus, and I drank of that life-giving stream; My thirst was quenched my soul revived, and now I live in Him.</p>
    <p class="verse">I heard the voice of Jesus say, &ldquo;I am this dark world&rsquo;s Light; Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise, and all thy day be bright.&rdquo; I looked to Jesus, and I found in Him my Star, my Sun; And in that light of life I&rsquo;ll walk, till traveling days are done.</p>
