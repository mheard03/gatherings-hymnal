    <h1>Saved By Grace</h1>
    <p class="verse">Someday the silver cord will break, And I no more as now shall sing; But oh, the joy when I shall wake Within the palace of the King!</p>
    <p class="chorus">And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace; And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">Someday my earthly house will fall. I cannot tell how soon &rsquo;twill be; But this I know&mdash;my All in All Has now a place in Heav&rsquo;n for me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace; And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">Someday, when fades the golden sun beneath the rosy-tinted west, My bless&egrave;d Lord will say, &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; And I shall enter into rest.</p>
    <p class="chorus">And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace; And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">Someday -- till then I&rsquo;ll watch and wait, My lamp all trimmed and burning bright, That when my Savior opes the gate, My soul to Him may take its flight.</p>
    <p class="chorus">And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace; And I shall see Him face to face, And tell the story&mdash;Saved by grace.</p>
