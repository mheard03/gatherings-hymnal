    <h1>Grace! 'Tis a Charming Sound</h1>
    <p class="verse">Grace! 'tis a charming sound, Harmonious to the ear; Heav'n with the echo shall resound, And all the earth shall hear.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved by grace alone! This is my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Twas grace that wrote my name In life's eternal book; 'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb Who all my sorrows took.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved by grace alone! This is my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Grace taught my wandering feet To tread the heavenly road; And new supplies each hour I meet While pressing on to God.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved by grace alone! This is my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Grace taught my soul to pray, And made my eyes o'erflow; 'Twas grace which kept me to this day, And will not let me go.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved by grace alone! This is my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Oh, let that grace inspire My soul with strength divine; May all my powers to Thee aspire, And all my days be Thine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved by grace alone! This is my plea: Jesus died for all mankind, and Jesus died for me.</p>
