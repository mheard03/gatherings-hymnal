    <h1>Tell Me the Old Old Story</h1>
    <p class="verse">Tell me the old, old story of unseen things above, Of Jesus and His glory, of Jesus and His love. Tell me the story simply, as to a little child, For I am weak and weary, and helpless and defiled.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell me the old, old story, tell me the old, old story, Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus and His love.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tell me the story slowly, that I may take it in, That wonderful redemption, God&rsquo;s remedy for sin. Tell me the story often, for I forget so soon; The early dew of morning has passed away at noon.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell me the old, old story, tell me the old, old story, Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus and His love.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tell me the story softly, with earnest tones and grave; Remember I&rsquo;m the sinner whom Jesus came to save. Tell me the story always, if you would really be, In any time of trouble, a comforter to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell me the old, old story, tell me the old, old story, Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus and His love.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tell me the same old story when you have cause to fear That this world&rsquo;s empty glory is costing me too dear. Yes, and when that world&rsquo;s glory is dawning on my soul, Tell me the old, old story: &ldquo;Christ Jesus makes thee whole.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell me the old, old story, tell me the old, old story, Tell me the old, old story, of Jesus and His love.</p>
