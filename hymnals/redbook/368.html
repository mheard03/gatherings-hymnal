    <h1>Have I Done My Best for Jesus?</h1>
    <p class="verse">I wonder have I done my best for Jesus, Who died upon the cruel tree? To think of His great sacrifice at Calvary! I know my Lord expects the best from me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">How many are the lost that I have lifted? How many are the chained I&rsquo;ve helped to free? I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus, When He has done so much for me?</p>
    <p class="verse">The hours that I have wasted are so many The hours I&rsquo;ve spent for Christ so few; Because of all my lack of love for Jesus, I wonder if His heart is breaking too.</p>
    <p class="chorus">How many are the lost that I have lifted? How many are the chained I&rsquo;ve helped to free? I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus, When He has done so much for me?</p>
    <p class="verse">I wonder have I cared enough for others, Or have I let them die alone? I might have helped a wand&rsquo;rer to the Saviour, The seed of precious Life I might have sown.</p>
    <p class="chorus">How many are the lost that I have lifted? How many are the chained I&rsquo;ve helped to free? I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus, When He has done so much for me?</p>
    <p class="verse">No longer will I stay within the valley I&rsquo;ll climb to mountain heights above; The world is dying now for want of someone To tell them of the Saviour&rsquo;s matchless love.</p>
    <p class="chorus">How many are the lost that I have lifted? How many are the chained I&rsquo;ve helped to free? I wonder, have I done my best for Jesus, When He has done so much for me?</p>
