    <h1>Jesus Loves Even Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">I am so glad that our Father in heav'n Tells of His love in the Book He has giv'n; Wonderful things in the Bible I see This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me; I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tho I forget Him and wander away, Still He doth love me wherever I stray; Back to His dear loving arms would I flee, When I remember that Jesus loves me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me; I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.</p>
    <p class="verse">O if there's only one song I can sing When in His beauty I see the great King, This shall my song in eternity be: &quot;O what a wonder, that Jesus loves me!&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me; I am so glad that Jesus loves me, Jesus loves even me.</p>
