    <h1>O, I Want to Be Like Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">O, I want to be like Jesus As I walk along this pilgrim way; O I want to live like Jesus, Showing fort His beauty every day. This my prayer and deepest longing &ndash; To be pure without, within; O, I want to be like Jesus. Cleansed from dross and free from self and sin.</p>
    <p class="verse">O I want to talk like Jesus- Gracious are the words from Him we hear; Words of life and hope for sinners, Tender, healing words of love and cheer. O the power and the value Of a fitly spoken word! O, I want to talk like Jesus Any time or place my voice is heard.</p>
    <p class="verse">O I want to serve like Jesus &ndash; Willingly He came from heaven above; On the earth He lived for others, Spent His life in kindly deeds of love. I would follow where He leads me And His bidding always do; O, I want to serve like Jesus Till my traveling days on earth are through.</p>
