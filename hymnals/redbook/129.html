    <h1>At the Cross</h1>
    <p class="verse">Alas! and did my Savior bleed? And did my Sov'reign die? Would He devote that sacred head For such a worm as I?</p>
    <p class="chorus">At the cross, at the cross, Where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day.</p>
    <p class="verse">Was it for crimes that I have done He groaned upon the tree? Amazing pity! Grace unknown! And love beyond degree!</p>
    <p class="chorus">At the cross, at the cross, Where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day.</p>
    <p class="verse">Well might the sun in darkens hide And shut its glories in, When Christ, the mighty Maker, died For man the creature's sin.</p>
    <p class="chorus">At the cross, at the cross, Where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day.</p>
    <p class="verse">But drops of grief can ne'er repay The debt of love I owe: Here, Lord, I give myself away - 'Tis all that I can do!</p>
    <p class="chorus">At the cross, at the cross, Where I first saw the light, And the burden of my heart rolled away It was there by faith I received my sight, And now I am happy all the day.</p>
