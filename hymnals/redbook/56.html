    <h1>I Am His and He is Mine</h1>
    <p class="verse">Loved with everlasting love, led by grace that love to know; Spirit breathing from above, Thou hast taught me it is so! O this full and perfect peace, O this transport all divine In a love which cannot cease, I am His, and He is mine. In a love which cannot cease, I am His, and He is mine.</p>
    <p class="verse">Heav&rsquo;n above is softer blue, Earth around is sweeter green! Something lives in every hue Christ-less eyes have never seen; Birds with gladder songs o&rsquo;er-flow, flowers with deeper beauties shine, Since I know, as now I know, I am His, and He is mine. Since I know, as now I know, I am His, and He is mine.</p>
    <p class="verse">Things that once were wild alarms cannot now disturb my rest; Closed in everlasting arms, pillowed on the loving breast. O to lie forever here, doubt and care and self-resign, While He whispers in my ear, I am His, and He is mine. While He whispers in my ear, I am His, and He is mine.</p>
    <p class="verse">His forever, only His; Who the Lord and me shall part? Ah, with what a rest of bliss Christ can fill the loving heart! Heav&rsquo;n and earth may fade and flee, firstborn light in gloom decline; But while God and I shall be, I am His, and He is mine. But while God and I shall be, I am His, and He is mine.</p>
