    <h1>Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken</h1>
    <p class="verse">Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God; He, whose word cannot be broken, formed thee for his own abode. On the Rock of Ages founded, what can shake thy sure repose? With salvation's walls surrounded, thou mayst smile at all thy foes.</p>
    <p class="verse">See, the streams of living waters, springing from eternal love well supply thy sons and daughters, and all fear of want remove. Who can faint while such a river ever will their thirst assuage? Grace which like the Lord, the giver, never fails from age to age.</p>
    <p class="verse">Round each habitation hovering, see the cloud and fire appear for a glory and a covering, showing that the Lord is near! Glorious things of thee are spoken, Zion, city of our God; He, whose word cannot be broken, formed thee for his own abode.</p>
