    <h1>What Will You Do with Jesus?</h1>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is standing in Pilate&rsquo;s hall&mdash;Friendless, forsaken betrayed by all: Hearken! what meaneth the sudden call! What will you do with Jesus?</p>
    <p class="chorus">What will you do with Jesus? Neutral you can-not be; Someday your heart will be asking &ldquo;What will He do with me?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is standing on trial still - You can be false to Him if you will, You can be faithful thru good or ill: What will you do with Jesus?</p>
    <p class="chorus">What will you do with Jesus? Neutral you can-not be; Someday your heart will be asking &ldquo;What will He do with me?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">Will you evade Him as Pilate tried? Or will you choose Him, what-er betide? Vainly you struggle from Him to hide: What will you do with Jesus?</p>
    <p class="chorus">What will you do with Jesus? Neutral you can-not be; Someday your heart will be asking &ldquo;What will He do with me?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">Will you, like Peter, your Lord deny? Or will you scorn from His foes to fly, Daring for Jesus to live or die? What will you do with Jesus?</p>
    <p class="chorus">What will you do with Jesus? Neutral you can-not be; Someday your heart will be asking &ldquo;What will He do with me?&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus, I give Thee my heart today! Jesus I&rsquo;ll follow thee all the way Gladly obeying Thee!&quot; will you say, &ldquo;This will I do with Jesus!&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">What will you do with Jesus? Neutral you can-not be; Someday your heart will be asking &ldquo;What will He do with me?&rdquo;</p>
