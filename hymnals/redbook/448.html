    <h1>He Ransomed Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">There&rsquo;s a sweet and blessed story Of the Christ who came from glory, Just to rescue me from sin and misery; He in loving-kindness sought me, And from sin and shame hath brought me, Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah! what a Savior, Who can take a poor, lost sinner, Lift him from the miry clay and set me free! I will ever tell the story, Shouting &ldquo;glory, glory, glory&rdquo;,Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.</p>
    <p class="verse">From the depth of sin and sadness To the heights of joy and gladness Jesus lifted me, in mercy full and free; With His precious blood He bought me, When I knew Him not, He sought me, And in love divine He ransomed me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah! what a Savior, Who can take a poor, lost sinner, Lift him from the miry clay and set me free! I will ever tell the story, Shouting &ldquo;glory, glory, glory&rdquo;,Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.</p>
    <p class="verse">By and by, with joy increasing, And with gratitude unceasing, Lifted up to be with Christ eternally, I will join the hosts there singing, In the anthem ever ringing, To the King of Love who ransomed me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hallelujah! what a Savior, Who can take a poor, lost sinner, Lift him from the miry clay and set me free! I will ever tell the story, Shouting &ldquo;glory, glory, glory&rdquo;,Hallelujah! Jesus ransomed me.</p>
