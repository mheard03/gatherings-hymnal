    <h1>I know Whom I Have Believed</h1>
    <p class="verse">I know not why God&rsquo;s wondrous grace To me He hath made known, Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love Redeemed me for His own.</p>
    <p class="chorus">But &ldquo;I know Whom I have believed, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I&rsquo;ve committed Unto Him against that day.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">I know not how this saving faith To me He did impart, Nor how believing in His Word Wrought peace within my heart.</p>
    <p class="chorus">But &ldquo;I know Whom I have believed, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I&rsquo;ve committed Unto Him against that day.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">I know not how the Spirit moves, Convincing men of sin, Revealing Jesus through the Word, Creating faith in Him.</p>
    <p class="chorus">But &ldquo;I know Whom I have believed, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I&rsquo;ve committed Unto Him against that day.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">I know not what of good or ill May be reserved for me, Of weary ways or golden days, Before His face I see.</p>
    <p class="chorus">But &ldquo;I know Whom I have believed, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I&rsquo;ve committed Unto Him against that day.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">I know not when my Lord may come, At night or noonday fair, Nor if I walk the vale with Him, Or meet Him in the air.</p>
    <p class="chorus">But &ldquo;I know Whom I have believed, And am persuaded that He is able To keep that which I&rsquo;ve committed Unto Him against that day.&rdquo;</p>
