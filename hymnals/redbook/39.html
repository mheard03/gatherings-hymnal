    <h1>This is My Father's World</h1>
    <p class="verse">This is my Father's world, and to my listening ears all nature sings, and round me rings the music of the spheres. This is my Father's world: I rest me in the thought of rocks and trees, of skies and seas; his hand the wonders wrought.</p>
    <p class="verse">This is my Father's world, the birds their carols raise, the morning light, the lily white, declare their maker's praise. This is my Father's world: he shines in all that's fair; in the rustling grass I hear him pass; he speaks to me everywhere.</p>
    <p class="verse">This is my Father's world. O let me ne'er forget that tho the wrong seems oft so strong, God is the ruler yet. This is my Father's world: The battle is not done; Jesus who died shall be satisfied and earth and heaven be one.</p>
