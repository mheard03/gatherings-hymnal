    <h1>The Great Creator</h1>
    <p class="verse">How I praise the great Creator, Who did make this world so fair; As I scan the realm of nature I can see His image there.</p>
    <p class="verse">In the steep and on the hilltop, There I find His royal throne; And the God who made the mountain Ever loves me as His own.</p>
    <p class="verse">Tiny bud and lovely flower, All the fragrant bloom of spring, Show the sweetness and the beauty Of our Sovereign and my King.</p>
    <p class="verse">Bubbling spring and swirling river, Lapping lake and tossing sea, All declare the might and greatness Of the One who care for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">How I praise the great Creator, Who did make the world so fair, For I too am His creation, And I love Him for His care.</p>
