    <h1>Sooner or Later</h1>
    <p class="verse">Sooner or later the skies will be bright, Tears will be all wiped away; Sooner or later, then cometh the light, Night will be turned into day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sooner or later cares will have flown, Sunshine and gladness we&rsquo;ll see Sooner or later God calleth His own, With Him forever to be.</p>
    <p class="verse">Sooner or later, our Lord knows the hour, He&rsquo;ll send His beloved Son; Sooner or later, in His might and power, Our battles all will be won.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sooner or later cares will have flown, Sunshine and gladness we&rsquo;ll see Sooner or later God calleth His own, With Him forever to be.</p>
    <p class="verse">Sooner or later, yes, sooner for some, Darkness will all then be past; Sooner or later our Savior will come &ndash; With Him will be your lot be cast?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sooner or later cares will have flown, Sunshine and gladness we&rsquo;ll see Sooner or later God calleth His own, With Him forever to be.</p>
