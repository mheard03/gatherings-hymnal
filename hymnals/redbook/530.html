    <h1>Battle Hynm of the Republic</h1>
    <p class="verse">Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored; He has loosed the fateful lightning of His terrible swift word&mdash;His truth is marching on.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glory! Glory Hallelujah! Glory! Glory Hallelujah! Glory! Glory, Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps, They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps; I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps-- His day is marching on.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glory! Glory Hallelujah! Glory! Glory Hallelujah! Glory! Glory, Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.</p>
    <p class="verse">He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never sound retreat, He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat; O be swift, my soul, to answer Him! Be jubilant, my feet!- Our God is marching on.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glory! Glory Hallelujah! Glory! Glory Hallelujah! Glory! Glory, Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.</p>
    <p class="verse">In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea, With a glory in His bosom that transfigures you and me; As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, While God is marching on.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glory! Glory Hallelujah! Glory! Glory Hallelujah! Glory! Glory, Hallelujah! His truth is marching on.</p>
