    <h1>Why Not Now ?</h1>
    <p class="verse">While we pray and while we plead, While you see your soul&rsquo;s deep need, While our Father calls you home, Will you not, my brother, come?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?</p>
    <p class="verse">You have wandered far away; Do not risk another day; Do not turn from God your face, But today accept His grace.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?</p>
    <p class="verse">In the world you&rsquo;ve failed to find Aught of peace for troubled mind; Come to Christ, on Him believe, Peace and joy you shall receive.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?</p>
    <p class="verse">Come to Christ, confession make; Come to Christ, and pardon take; Trust in Him from day to day, He will keep you all the way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now? Why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?</p>
