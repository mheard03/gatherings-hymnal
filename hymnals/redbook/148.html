    <h1>Will Jesus Find Us Watching?</h1>
    <p class="verse">When Jesus comes to reward His servants, Whether it be noon or night, Faithful to Him will He find us watching, With our lamps all trimmed and bright?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, can we say we are ready, brother? Ready for the soul&rsquo;s bright home? Say, will He find you and me still watching, Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?</p>
    <p class="verse">If, at the dawn of the early morning, He shall call us one by one, When to the Lord we restore our talents, Will He answer thee, &ldquo;Well done&rdquo;?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, can we say we are ready, brother? Ready for the soul&rsquo;s bright home? Say, will He find you and me still watching, Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?</p>
    <p class="verse">Have we been true to the trust He left us? Do we seek to do our best? If in our hearts there is naught condemns us, We shall have a glorious rest.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, can we say we are ready, brother? Ready for the soul&rsquo;s bright home? Say, will He find you and me still watching, Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?</p>
    <p class="verse">Blessed are those whom the Lord finds watching, In His glory they shall share; If He shall come at the dawn or midnight, Will He find us watching there?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, can we say we are ready, brother? Ready for the soul&rsquo;s bright home? Say, will He find you and me still watching, Waiting, waiting when the Lord shall come?</p>
