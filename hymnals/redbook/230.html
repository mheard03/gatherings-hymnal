    <h1>Saved, Saved !</h1>
    <p class="verse">I've found a Friend who is all to me, His love is ever true; I love to tell how He lifted me And what His grace can do for you.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved by His pow'r divine, Saved to new life sublime! Life now is sweet and my joy is complete, For I'm saved, saved, saved!</p>
    <p class="verse">He saves me from every sin and harm, Secures my soul each day; I'm leaning strong on His mighty arm; I know He'll guide me all the way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved by His pow'r divine, Saved to new life sublime! Life now is sweet and my joy is complete, For I'm saved, saved, saved!</p>
    <p class="verse">When poor and needy and all alone, In love He said to me, &quot;Come unto Me and I'll lead you home, To live with Me eternally.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Saved by His pow'r divine, Saved to new life sublime! Life now is sweet and my joy is complete, For I'm saved, saved, saved!</p>
