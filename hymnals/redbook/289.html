    <h1>Does Jesus Care?</h1>
    <p class="verse">Does Jesus care when my heart is pained Too deeply for mirth and song; As the burdens press, and the cares distress, And the way grows weary and long?</p>
    <p class="chorus">O yes, He cares- I know He cares! His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary, The long nights dreary, I know my Savior cares. (He cares.)</p>
    <p class="verse">Does Jesus care when my way is dark With a nameless dread and fear? As the daylight fades into deep night shades, Does He care enough to be near?</p>
    <p class="chorus">O yes, He cares- I know He cares! His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary, The long nights dreary, I know my Savior cares. (He cares</p>
    <p class="verse">Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed To resist some temptation strong; When for my deep grief I find no relief, Tho my tears flow all the night long?</p>
    <p class="chorus">O yes, He cares- I know He cares! His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary, The long nights dreary, I know my Savior cares. (He cares</p>
    <p class="verse">Does Jesus care when I've said goodbye To the dearest on earth to me, And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks Is it aught to Him? Does He see?</p>
    <p class="chorus">O yes, He cares- I know He cares! His heart is touched with my grief; When the days are weary, The long nights dreary, I know my Savior cares. (He cares</p>
