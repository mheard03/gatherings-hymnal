    <h1>Soldiers of Christ Arise</h1>
    <p class="verse">Soldiers of Christ arise, and put your armor on, strong in the strength which God supplies thru his eternal Son; strong in the Lord of Hosts, and in his mighty power, who in the strength of Jesus trusts is more than conqueror.</p>
    <p class="verse">Stand then in his great might, with all his strength endued, and take to arm you for the fight the panoply of God; that having all things done, and all your conflicts past, ye may o'er-come thru Christ alone and stand entire at last.</p>
    <p class="verse">Leave no unguarded place, no weakness of the soul, Take every virtue, every grace, And fortify the whole. From strength to strength go on, Wrestle and fight and pray, Tread all the power of darkness down and win the well-fought day.</p>
