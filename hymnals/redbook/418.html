    <h1>Must I Go, and Empty-Handed</h1>
    <p class="verse">&ldquo;Must I go, and empty handed,&rdquo; Thus my dear Redeemer meet? Not one day of service give Him, Lay no trophy at His feet?</p>
    <p class="chorus">&ldquo;Must I go, and empty handed?&rdquo; Must I meet my Savior so? Not one soul with which to greet Him, Must I empty handed go?</p>
    <p class="verse">Not at death I shrink or falter, For my Savior saves me now; But to meet Him empty handed, Thought of that now clouds my brow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">&ldquo;Must I go, and empty handed?&rdquo; Must I meet my Savior so? Not one soul with which to greet Him, Must I empty handed go?</p>
    <p class="verse">O the years in sinning wasted! Could I but recall them now, I would give them to my Savior, To His will I&rsquo;d gladly bow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">&ldquo;Must I go, and empty handed?&rdquo; Must I meet my Savior so? Not one soul with which to greet Him, Must I empty handed go?</p>
    <p class="verse">O ye saints, arouse, be earnest, Up and work while yet &rsquo;tis day; Ere the night of death o&rsquo;ertake thee, Strive for souls while still you may.</p>
    <p class="chorus">&ldquo;Must I go, and empty handed?&rdquo; Must I meet my Savior so? Not one soul with which to greet Him, Must I empty handed go?</p>
