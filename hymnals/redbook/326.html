    <h1>More About Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">More about Jesus I would know, More of His grace to others show; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">More, more about Jesus, More, more about Jesus; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">More about Jesus let me learn, More of His holy will discern; Spirit of God, my teacher be, Showing the things of Christ to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">More, more about Jesus, More, more about Jesus; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">More about Jesus, in His Word, Holding communion with my Lord; Hearing His voice in every line, Making each faithful saying mine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">More, more about Jesus, More, more about Jesus; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">More about Jesus on His throne, Riches in glory all His own; More of His kingdom&rsquo;s sure increase; More of His coming, Prince of Peace.</p>
    <p class="chorus">More, more about Jesus, More, more about Jesus; More of His saving fullness see, More of His love who died for me.</p>
