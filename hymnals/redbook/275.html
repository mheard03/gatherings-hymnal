    <h1>I Belong to the King</h1>
    <p class="verse">I belong to the King; I&rsquo;m a child of His love, I shall dwell in His palace so fair, For He tells of its bliss in yon heaven above, And His children in splendors shall share.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I belong to the King; I&rsquo;m a child of His love, And he never forsaketh His own. He will call me some day to His palace above; I shall dwell by His glorified throne.</p>
    <p class="verse">I belong to the King, and He loves me I know, For His mercy and kindness so free Are unceasingly mine where so ever I go, And my Refuge unfailing is He.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I belong to the King; I&rsquo;m a child of His love, And he never forsaketh His own. He will call me some day to His palace above; I shall dwell by His glorified throne.</p>
    <p class="verse">I belong to the King, and His promise is sure: That we all shall be gathered at last In His kingdom above, by life&rsquo;s waters so pure, When this life with its trials is past.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I belong to the King; I&rsquo;m a child of His love, And he never forsaketh His own. He will call me some day to His palace above; I shall dwell by His glorified throne.</p>
