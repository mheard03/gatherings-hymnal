    <h1>A Christian Home</h1>
    <p class="verse">O give us homes built firm upon the Saviour, Where Christ is Head, and Counsellor and Guide; Where ev'ry child is taught His love and favor And gives his heart to Christ, the crucified: How sweet to know that tho' his footsteps waver His faithful Lord is walking by his side!</p>
    <p class="verse">O give us homes with godly fathers, mothers, Who always place their hope and trust in Him; Whose tender patience turmoil never bothers, Whose calm and courage trouble cannot dim; A home where each finds joy in serving others, And love still shines, tho days be dark and grim.</p>
    <p class="verse">O give us homes where Christ is Lord and Master, The Bible read, the precious hymns still sung; Where prayer comes first in peace or in disaster, And praise is natural speech to ev'ry tongue; Where mountains move before a faith that's vaster, And Christ sufficient is for old and young.</p>
    <p class="verse">O Lord, our God, our homes are Thine forever! We trust to Thee their problems toil, and care; Their bonds of love no enemy can sever If Thou art always Lord and Master there: Be Thou the center of our least endeavor: Be Thou our Guest, our hearts and homes to share.</p>
