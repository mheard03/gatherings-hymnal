    <h1>He Leadeth Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">He leadeth me: O blessed thought! O words with heavenly comfort fraught! Whate'er I do, where'er I be, still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He leadeth me, he leadeth me, by his own hand he leadeth me; his faithful follower I would be, for by his hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Sometimes &lsquo;mid scenes of deepest gloom, sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom, by waters still, o'er troubled sea, still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He leadeth me, he leadeth me, by his own hand he leadeth me; his faithful follower I would be, for by his hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Lord, I would clasp my hand in thine, nor ever murmur nor repine; content, whatever lot I see, since 'tis my God that leadeth me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He leadeth me, he leadeth me, by his own hand he leadeth me; his faithful follower I would be, for by his hand he leadeth me.</p>
    <p class="verse">And when my task on earth is done, when by thy grace the victory's won, e'en death's cold wave I will not flee, since God thru Jordan leadeth me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He leadeth me, he leadeth me, by his own hand he leadeth me; his faithful follower I would be, for by his hand he leadeth me.</p>
