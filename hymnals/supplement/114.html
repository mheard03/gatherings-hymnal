    <h1>It&rsquo;s In His Name</h1>
    <p class="verse">There is a rest in every woe; There is a refuge from the foe, There is a peace this world can't know; It's in his name. There is a glow in darkest night, A dawn of hope, a guiding light, There is a help in helpless plight; It's in his name, It's in his name.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His name is Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God; His name is Jesus, and he's ever the same. There is a calm when fear assails; There is power all nature hails. There is a love that never fails; It's in his name, It's in his name.</p>
    <p class="verse">There is an all-sufficient grace, A welcome smile, a warm embrace; There is a sweet abiding place, It's in his name. There is a promise for each need, A helping hand to intercede, A tender voice to cheer and lead, It's in his name, it's in his name.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His name is Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God; His name is Jesus, and he's ever the same. There is a calm when fear assails; There is a power all nature hails. There is a love that never fails; It's in his name, It's in his name.</p>
