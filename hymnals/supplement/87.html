    <h1>He Abides</h1>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;m rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way, For the hand of God in all my life I see; And the reason of my bliss, yes, the secret all is this: That the Comforter abides with me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He abides, he abides; Hallelujah, he abides with me! I&rsquo;m rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way, For the Comforter abides with me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Once my heart was full of sin, once I had no peace within, Till I heard how Jesus died upon the tree; Then I fell down at his feet, and there came a peace so sweet; Now the Comforter abides with me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He abides, he abides; Hallelujah, he abides with me! I&rsquo;m rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way, For the Comforter abides with me.</p>
    <p class="verse">He is with me everywhere, and he knows my every care; I&rsquo;m as happy as a bird and just as free; For the Spirit has control; Jesus satisfies my soul, Since the Comforter abides with me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He abides, he abides; Hallelujah, he abides with me! I&rsquo;m rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way, For the Comforter abides with me.</p>
    <p class="verse">There&rsquo;s no thirsting for the things of the world: they&rsquo;ve taken wings; Long ago I gave them up, and instantly All my night was turned to day, all my burdens rolled away; Now the Comforter abides with me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He abides, he abides; Hallelujah, he abides with me! I&rsquo;m rejoicing night and day as I walk the narrow way, For the Comforter abides with me.</p>
