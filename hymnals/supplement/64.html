    <h1>I Love Him</h1>
    <p class="verse">Gone from my heart the world and all its charms; Now through the blood I&rsquo;m saved from all alarms; Down at the cross my heart is bending low; The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I love him, I love him, because he first loved me, And purchased my salvation on Calv&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s tree.</p>
    <p class="verse">Once I was lost, and way down deep in sin; Once was a slave to passions fierce within; Once was afraid to meet an angry God But now I&rsquo;m cleansed from ev&rsquo;ry stain through Jesus&rsquo; blood.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I love him, I love him, because he first loved me, And purchased my salvation on Calv&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s tree.</p>
    <p class="verse">Once I was bound, but now I am set free; Once I was blind, but now the light I see; Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live, To tell the world around the peace that he doth give.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I love him, I love him, because he first loved me, And purchased my salvation on Calv&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s tree.</p>
