    <h1>O I Want To See Him</h1>
    <p class="verse">As I journey thro&rsquo; the land, singing as I go, Pointing souls to Calvary, to the crimson flow, Many arrows pierce my soul from without, within; But my Lord leads me on, thro&rsquo; him I must win.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O I want to see him, look upon his face, There to sing forever of his saving grace; On the streets of glory let me lift my voice, Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.</p>
    <p class="verse">When in service for my Lord dark may be the night, But I&rsquo;ll cling more close to him, he will give me light; Satan&rsquo;s snares may vex my soul, turn my tho&rsquo;ts aside; But my Lord goes ahead, leads whate&rsquo;er betide.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O I want to see him, look upon his face, There to sing forever of his saving grace; On the streets of glory let me lift my voice, Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.</p>
    <p class="verse">When in valleys low I look t'ward the mountain height, And behold my Savior there, leading in the fight, With a tender hand outstretched t'ward the valley low, Guiding me, I can see, as I onward go.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O I want to see him, look upon his face, There to sing forever of his saving grace; On the streets of glory let me lift my voice, Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.</p>
    <p class="verse">When before me billows rise from the mighty deep, Then my Lord directs my bark; he doth safely keep, And he leads me gently on thro&rsquo; this world below; He&rsquo;s a real friend to me, O I love him so.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O I want to see him, look upon his face, There to sing forever of his saving grace; On the streets of glory let me lift my voice, Cares all past, home at last, ever to rejoice.</p>
