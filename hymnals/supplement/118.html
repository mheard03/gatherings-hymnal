    <h1>Leave Your Burden at the Place of Prayer</h1>
    <p class="verse">When the clouds are hanging low, When the raging tempests blow, When your soul is burdened with its weight of care; There's a place of perfect rest,Where no evil can molest;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Leave your burden at the place of prayer. Take to Jesus all your want and care; For he is a friend indeed, And supplieth every need; Leave your burden at the place of prayer.</p>
    <p class="verse">There is rest for you today,Though you walk life's busy way, There is one who waits your heavy load to bear; Jesus understands your need, Your petition he will heed;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Leave your burden at the place of prayer. Take to Jesus all your want and care; For he is a friend indeed, And supplieth every need; Leave your burden at the place of prayer.</p>
    <p class="verse">Bring your load of doubts and fears, All the burdens of the years, You may meet your Savior and his blessings share; Bring your troubles not a few, Jesus will your strength renew; Leave your burden at the place of prayer.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Leave your burden at the place of prayer. Take to Jesus all your want and care; For he is a friend indeed, And supplieth every need; Leave your burden at the place of prayer.</p>
    <p class="verse">We shall soon from care be free, With our eyes his glory see, O the blessedness of peace awaiting there; Till that glorious day has come, Till your race on earth is done;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Leave your burden at the place of prayer. Take to Jesus all your want and care; For he is a friend indeed, And supplieth every need; Leave your burden at the place of prayer.</p>
