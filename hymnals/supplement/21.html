    <h1>His Blood Is On My Soul</h1>
    <p class="verse">Dear Jesus all my sins forgave, and washed and made me whole, I have sweet peace and joy within, his blood is on my soul.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His blood is on my soul, his blood is on my soul, I rest securely in his hand, his blood is on my soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">The tempter can not overcome, or gain the least control, I have God&rsquo;s everlasting seal, Christ&rsquo;s blood is on my soul.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His blood is on my soul, his blood is on my soul, I rest securely in his hand, his blood is on my soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have his Spirit now within, my life in his control, I&rsquo;m ready for the crowning day, his blood is on my soul.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His blood is on my soul, his blood is on my soul, I rest securely in his hand, his blood is on my soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">I am determined by his grace to reach bright heaven&rsquo;s goal, And reign with Jesus on his throne, his blood is on my soul.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His blood is on my soul, his blood is on my soul, I rest securely in his hand, his blood is on my soul.</p>
