    <h1>Glory to God, Hallelujah</h1>
    <p class="verse">We are never, never weary of the grand old song; Glory to God, hallelujah! We can sing it loud as ever, with our faith more strong; Glory to God, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing, For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing; We are going by and by to the palace of a King! Glory to God, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="verse">We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love, Glory to God, hallelujah! We are rising on its pinions to the hills above: Glory to God, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing, For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing; We are going by and by to the palace of a King! Glory to God, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="verse">We are going to a palace that is built of gold; Glory to God, hallelujah! Where the King in all his splendor we shall soon behold! Glory to God, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing, For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing; We are going by and by to the palace of a King! Glory to God, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="verse">There we&rsquo;ll shout redeeming mercy in a glad, new song; Glory to God, hallelujah! There we&rsquo;ll sing the praise of Jesus with the blood-washed throng; Glory to God, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="chorus">O, the children of the Lord have a right to shout and sing, For the way is growing bright, and our souls are on the wing; We are going by and by to the palace of a King! Glory to God, hallelujah!</p>
