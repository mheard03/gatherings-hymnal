    <h1>The Old Account Was Settled</h1>
    <p class="verse">There was a time on earth, when in the book of Heav&rsquo;n, An old account was standing for sins yet unforgiv&rsquo;n; My name was at the top, and many things below, I went unto the Keeper, and settled long ago.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Long ago, long ago, Yes, the old account was settled long ago; And the record&rsquo;s clear today, for he washed my sins away, When the old account was settled long ago.</p>
    <p class="verse">The old account was large, and growing every day, For I was always sinning, and never tried to pay; But when I looked ahead, and saw such pain and woe, I said that I would settle, I settled long ago.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Long ago, long ago, Yes, the old account was settled long ago; And the record&rsquo;s clear today, for he washed my sins away, When the old account was settled long ago.</p>
    <p class="verse">When in that happy home, my Savior&rsquo;s home above, I&rsquo;ll sing redemption&rsquo;s story, and praise him for his love; I&rsquo;ll not forget that book, with pages white as snow, Because I came and settled, and settled long ago.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Long ago, long ago, Yes, the old account was settled long ago; And the record&rsquo;s clear today, for he washed my sins away, When the old account was settled long ago.</p>
    <p class="verse">O sinner, trust the Lord, be cleansed of all your sin, For thus he hath provided for you to enter in; And then if you should live a hundred years below, Up there you&rsquo;ll not regret it, you settled long ago.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Long ago, long ago, Yes, the old account was settled long ago; And the record&rsquo;s clear today, for he washed my sins away, When the old account was settled long ago.</p>
