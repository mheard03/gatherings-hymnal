    <h1>The Way of the Cross</h1>
    <p class="verse">I must needs go home by the way of the cross, There's no other way but this; I shall ne'er get sight of the gates of light, If the way of the cross I miss.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The way of the cross leads home, (leads home,) The way of the cross leads home; (leads home;) It is sweet to know as I onward go, The way of the cross leads home.</p>
    <p class="verse">I must needs go on in the blood sprinkled way, The path that the Savior trod, If I ever climb to the heights sublime, Where the soul is at home with God.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The way of the cross leads home, (leads home,) The way of the cross leads home; (leads home;) It is sweet to know as I onward go, The way of the cross leads home.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then I bid farewell to the way of the world, To walk in it nevermore, For the Lord says, &quot;Come,&quot; and I seek my home Where he waits at the open door.</p>
    <p class="chorus">The way of the cross leads home, (leads home,) The way of the cross leads home; (leads home;) It is sweet to know as I onward go, The way of the cross leads home.</p>
