    <h1>No One Ever Cared For Me Like Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">I would love to tell you what I think of Jesus, Since I found in him a friend so strong and true. I would tell you how he changed my life completely; He did something that no other friend could do.</p>
    <p class="chorus">No one ever cared for me like Jesus; There's no other friend so kind as he. No one else could take the sin and darkness from me; O how much he cared for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">All my life was full of sin when Jesus found me; All my heart was full of misery and woe. Jesus placed his strong and loving arms around me, And he led me in the way I ought to go.</p>
    <p class="chorus">No one ever cared for me like Jesus; There's no other friend so kind as he. No one else could take the sin and darkness from me; O how much he cared for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Every day he comes to me with new assurance; More and more I understand his words of love. But I'll never know just why he came to save me, Till someday I see his blessed face above.</p>
    <p class="chorus">No one ever cared for me like Jesus; There's no other friend so kind as he. No one else could take the sin and darkness from me; O how much he cared for me.</p>
