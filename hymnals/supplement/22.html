    <h1>Since Jesus Came Into My Heart</h1>
    <p class="verse">What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought, Since Jesus came into my heart! I have light in my soul for which long I had sought, Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have ceased from my wandering and going astray, Since Jesus came into my heart! And my sins, which were many, are all washed away, Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart.</p>
    <p class="verse">I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure, Since Jesus came into my heart! And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure, Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart.</p>
    <p class="verse">There's a light in the valley of death now for me, Since Jesus came into my heart! And the gates of the city beyond I can see, Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart.</p>
    <p class="verse">I shall go there to dwell in that city, I know, Since Jesus came into my heart! And I'm happy, so happy, as onward I go, Since Jesus came into my heart!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Since Jesus came into my heart, Since Jesus came into my heart, Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll, Since Jesus came into my heart.</p>
