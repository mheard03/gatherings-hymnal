    <h1>I&rsquo;m In This Church</h1>
    <p class="verse">I'm in this church, this glorious church, I didn&rsquo;t join, no, I was born, I&rsquo;ve had a new birth, Some glorious day, I'm gonna sail away, It&rsquo;s by his grace, not by my works, I&rsquo;m in this church.</p>
    <p class="verse">When Jesus came he was left out, There was no place where he was welcome here on earth, But he had a plan for a house that shall forever stand. He spoke these words, &quot;Upon this rock I&rsquo;ll build my church.&quot;</p>
    <p class="verse">I'm in this church, this glorious church, I didn&rsquo;t join, no, I was born, I&rsquo;ve had a new birth, Some glorious day, I'm gonna sail away, It&rsquo;s by his grace, not by my works, I&rsquo;m in this church.</p>
