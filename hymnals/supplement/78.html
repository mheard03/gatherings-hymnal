    <h1>I Love To Walk With Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">O I love to walk with Jesus, Like the publicans of old, When he gathered them about him And the blessed tidings told; How he came to bring deliv'rance To the captives in distress, Take away our ev&rsquo;ry burden, Giving perfect peace and rest.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will follow where he leadeth; I will pasture where he feedeth. I will follow all the way, Lord. I will follow Jesus ev&rsquo;ry day.</p>
    <p class="verse">O I love to walk with Jesus Like the man of long ago Who had tarried by the wayside Near the gates of Jericho, Jesus heard his cry for mercy, Gave him back his sight that day, And immediately he followed Jesus all along the way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will follow where he leadeth; I will pasture where he feedeth. I will follow all the way, Lord. I will follow Jesus ev&rsquo;ry day.</p>
    <p class="verse">O I love to walk with Jesus All the way to Calv&rsquo;ry&rsquo;s brow, Gaze upon that scene of suffering While my tears of sorrow flow. There he tells me how he loves me, Takes my ev&rsquo;ry sin away; So I follow him so gladly, Lead me anywhere he may.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will follow where he leadeth; I will pasture where he feedeth. I will follow all the way, Lord. I will follow Jesus ev&rsquo;ry day.</p>
    <p class="verse">O sometime I&rsquo;ll walk with Jesus In that land of endless day, When our journey here is over And we&rsquo;ve reached our home to stay. Then I&rsquo;ll walk with him forever, Sing his praises o&rsquo;er and o&rsquo;er, And with all the saints in glory Love, and worship, and adore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I will follow where he leadeth; I will pasture where he feedeth. I will follow all the way, Lord. I will follow Jesus ev&rsquo;ry day.</p>
