    <h1>Nailed To The Cross</h1>
    <p class="verse">There was one who was willing to die in my stead, That a soul so unworthy might live; And the path to the cross he was willing to tread, All the sins of my life to forgive.</p>
    <p class="chorus">They are nailed to the cross, They are nailed to the cross, O how much he was willing to bear! With what anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross! But he carried my sins with him there.</p>
    <p class="verse">He is tender and loving and patient with me, While he cleanses my heart of its dross; But &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no condemnation,&rdquo; I know I am free, For my sins are all nailed to the cross.</p>
    <p class="chorus">They are nailed to the cross, They are nailed to the cross, O how much he was willing to bear! With what anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross! But he carried my sins with him there.</p>
    <p class="verse">I will cling to my Savior and never depart, I will joyfully journey each day, With a song on my lips and a song in my heart, That my sins have been taken away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">They are nailed to the cross, They are nailed to the cross, O how much he was willing to bear! With what anguish and loss Jesus went to the cross! But he carried my sins with him there.</p>
