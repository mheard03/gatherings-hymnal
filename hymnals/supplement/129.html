    <h1>In The Gatherings</h1>
    <p class="verse">In the gatherings of the Christians, All may prophesy we're told, One by one to share and comfort, Speaking forth for Christ so bold.</p>
    <p class="chorus">In the church each saint must function, This is God's desire today, From the least one to the greatest, Christ expressed in every way.</p>
    <p class="verse">Love that's free from all pretension, Giving hospitality,Some so cheerful, showing mercy, All to pray continually.</p>
    <p class="chorus">In the church each saint must function, This is God's desire today, From the least one to the greatest, Christ expressed in every way.</p>
    <p class="verse">Some to teach and some exhorting, Some to minister and serve, Some with diligence for leading, Each his function must observe.</p>
    <p class="chorus">In the church each saint must function, This is God's desire today, From the least one to the greatest, Christ expressed in every way.</p>
    <p class="verse">Some with verse or testimony, Some with song their Christ can share, Each with strong and ready spirit, None in bondage to his chair!</p>
    <p class="chorus">In the church each saint must function, This is God's desire today, From the least one to the greatest, Christ expressed in every way.</p>
    <p class="verse">For the spirits of the prophets, To the prophets subject are, Each must exercise his spirit, That's what gifts are given for.</p>
    <p class="chorus">In the church each saint must function, This is God's desire today, From the least one to the greatest, Christ expressed in every way.</p>
