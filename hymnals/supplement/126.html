    <h1>Nothing&rsquo;s Quite So Precious</h1>
    <p class="verse">Nothing&rsquo;s quite so precious as Jesus in my spirit. He takes away the care and fills me with his peace. He never leaves me, e&rsquo;en as the days grow weary. His presence goes with me. My soul delights to hide in his arms.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I call his name, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, help me in my weakness.&rdquo; So faithfully each day in me he proves his life is so sufficient.</p>
    <p class="verse">Nothing&rsquo;s quite so precious as Jesus in my spirit. He turns my heart to him to feast upon his life. It&rsquo;s nothing I do, his mercy&rsquo;s just upon me. And God&rsquo;s free gift of grace becomes an endless joy to me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I call his name, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, help me in my weakness.&rdquo; So faithfully each day in me he proves his life is so sufficient.</p>
