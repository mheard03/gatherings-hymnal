    <h1>Sing Aloud Your Praises</h1>
    <p class="verse">Sing aloud your praises to the Lord of all, Now he is dwelling in Jerusalem. Tell among us all his doings great and small, His throne, the heavens, yet he walks with men. Oh, the salvation out of Zion comes; He brought us back from our captivity. Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad; Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad;</p>
    <p class="verse">In the holy city with his own he dwells; O Lord, our Lord, how excellent thy name! He&rsquo;s enthroned upon the praises of his saints; All his delight in Zion does remain. Lift up your heart ye body of the Lord, He is our portion, we are satisfied. Oh, what a goodly heritage have we; Oh, what a goodly heritage have we!</p>
    <p class="verse">Look! God&rsquo;s tabernacle now is with the saints; Emmanuel, God with us, we proclaim. Everything is done, so let his children come, Christ and the church where God and man are one! Lift up your heads, ye children of the King; Open your gates and let the King come in. He will come in, and he shall live and reign; He will come in, and he shall live and reign!</p>
