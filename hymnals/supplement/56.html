    <h1>Glad Reunion Day</h1>
    <p class="verse">There will be a happy meeting in heaven I know, When we see the many loved ones we've known here below, Gather to the blessed Savior with hearts all aglow,</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glad day, a wonderful day, Glad day, a glorious day; There with all the holy angels and Jesus to stay, That will be a glad reunion day.</p>
    <p class="verse">There within the holy city we'll sing and rejoice, Praising Christ the blessed Savior with heart and with voice, Praise him that we came to love him and make him our choice, That will be a glad reunion day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glad day, a wonderful day, Glad day, a glorious day; There with all the holy angels and Jesus to stay, That will be a glad reunion day.</p>
    <p class="verse">When we've lived a million years in that wonderful place, Basking in the love of Jesus beholding his face, It will seem but just a moment of praising his grace,</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glad day, a wonderful day, Glad day, a glorious day; There with all the holy angels and Jesus to stay, That will be a glad reunion day.</p>
