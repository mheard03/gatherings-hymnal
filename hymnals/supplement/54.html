    <h1>The Glory of His Presence</h1>
    <p class="verse">I have walked alone with Jesus in a fellowship Divine, Nevermore can earth allure me, I am his and he is mine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I have seen him, I have known him, for he deigns to walk with me; And the glory of his presence will be mine eternally, O the glory of his presence, O the beauty of his face. I am his and his forever, he has won me by his grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">On the mountain I have seen him, Christ my comforter and friend; And the glory of that vision will be with me to the end.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I have seen him, I have known him, for he deigns to walk with me; And the glory of his presence will be mine eternally, O the glory of his presence, O the beauty of his face. I am his and his forever, he has won me by his grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">In my failure, sin and sorrow, broken- hearted crushed and torn, I have felt his presence near me, he has all my burdens borne,</p>
    <p class="chorus">I have seen him, I have known him, for he deigns to walk with me; And the glory of his presence will be mine eternally, O the glory of his presence, O the beauty of his face. I am his and his forever, he has won me by his grace.</p>
    <p class="verse">In the darkness, in the shadow, with the Saviour I have trod, Sweet indeed have been the lessons since I&rsquo;ve walked alone with God.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I have seen him, I have known him, for he deigns to walk with me; And the glory of his presence will be mine eternally, O the glory of his presence, O the beauty of his face. I am his and his forever, he has won me by his grace.</p>
