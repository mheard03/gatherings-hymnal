    <h1>Did You Think To Pray</h1>
    <p class="verse">Ere you left your room this morning, Did you think to pray? In the name of Christ our Savior, Did you sue for loving favor, As a shield today?</p>
    <p class="chorus">O how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day; So when life seems dark and dreary, Don&rsquo;t forget to pray.</p>
    <p class="verse">When you met with great temptation, Did you think to pray? By his dying love and merit, Did you claim the Holy Spirit As your guide and stay?</p>
    <p class="chorus">O how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day; So when life seems dark and dreary, Don&rsquo;t forget to pray.</p>
    <p class="verse">When your heart was filled with anger, Did you think to pray? Did you plead for grace, my brother, That you might forgive another Who had crossed your way?</p>
    <p class="chorus">O how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day; So when life seems dark and dreary, Don&rsquo;t forget to pray.</p>
    <p class="verse">When sore trials came upon you, Did you think to pray? When your soul was bowed in sorrow, Balm of Gilead did you borrow At the gates of day?</p>
    <p class="chorus">O how praying rests the weary! Prayer will change the night to day; So when life seems dark and dreary, Don&rsquo;t forget to pray.</p>
