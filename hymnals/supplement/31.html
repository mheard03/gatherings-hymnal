    <h1>Unto Him</h1>
    <p class="verse">With praise and thanksgiving, there stands a great throng In the presence of Jesus, and sing this new song:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Unto him who hath loved us and washed us from sin, Unto him be the glory forever, Amen.</p>
    <p class="verse">All these once were sinners, defiled in his sight, Now arrayed in pure garments in praise they unite:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Unto him who hath loved us and washed us from sin, Unto him be the glory forever, Amen.</p>
    <p class="verse">He maketh the rebel a priest and a king, He hath bought us and taught us this new song to sing:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Unto him who hath loved us and washed us from sin, Unto him be the glory forever, Amen.</p>
    <p class="verse">How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been, If he never had loved us till cleansed from our sin:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Unto him who hath loved us and washed us from sin, Unto him be the glory forever, Amen.</p>
    <p class="verse">Aloud in his praises our voices shall ring, So that others believing, this new song shall sing:</p>
    <p class="chorus">Unto him who hath loved us and washed us from sin, Unto him be the glory forever, Amen.</p>
