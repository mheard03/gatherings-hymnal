    <h1>Well I&rsquo;m On My Way</h1>
    <p class="verse">In a far off land lived a man, old Elijah was his name, And he stood alone for the Lord in his day, Well they heard him sigh and then cry, As a golden chariot came, &quot;O happy day! Well I'm on my way!&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Well I'm on my way, to a mansion in the sky, Well I'm on my way to an everlasting by and by. Just turn to him and let him free you from your sin, And you will say, &quot;O happy day! Well I'm on my way!&quot;</p>
    <p class="verse">The Apostle Paul spoke to all of redeeming, saving grace, And he cried, &quot;Repent, do it now, don't delay!&quot; Well they took his head, now he's dead, But his writings plainly say, &quot;O happy day! Well I'm on my way!&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Well I'm on my way, to a mansion in the sky, Well I'm on my way to an everlasting by and by. Just turn to him and let him free you from your sin, And you will say, &quot;O happy day! Well I'm on my way!&quot;</p>
    <p class="verse">There among the trees on his knees martyr Stephen looked about, Then he cast his eyes to the skies for to pray, As he felt the stones crush his bones he resounded with a shout, &quot;O happy day! Well I'm on my way!&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Well I'm on my way, to a mansion in the sky, Well I'm on my way to an everlasting by and by. Just turn to him and let him free you from your sin, And you will say, &quot;O happy day! Well I'm on my way!&quot;</p>
