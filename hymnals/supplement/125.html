    <h1>Praise The Lord God Sent His Son</h1>
    <p class="verse">Praise the Lord, God sent his Son, Hallelujah! And salvation&rsquo;s work was done, Glory to God! God himself became a man so that we might live in him.</p>
    <p class="chorus">That&rsquo;s why I call on him, I give my all to him.</p>
    <p class="verse">For us he was crucified, Hallelujah! For the many, one man died, Glory to God! One grain fell into the earth, many grains to bring to birth.</p>
    <p class="chorus">That&rsquo;s why I call on him, I give my all to him.</p>
    <p class="verse">He arose in victory, Hallelujah! From the grave, triumphantly, Glory to God! Now in resurrection he as the Spirit lives in me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">That&rsquo;s why I call on him, I give my all to him.</p>
    <p class="verse">Call on him from deep within, Hallelujah! Just by calling he comes in, Glory to God! Once you call upon his name, nevermore you&rsquo;ll be the same.</p>
    <p class="chorus">That&rsquo;s why I call on him, I give my all to him.</p>
