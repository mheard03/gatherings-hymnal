    <h1>I&rsquo;ve Anchored In Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">Upon life's boundless ocean where mighty billows roll, I've fixed my hope in Jesus, blest anchor of my soul. When trials fierce assail me as storms are gath'ring o'er,I rest upon his mercy and trust him more.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I've anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave, I've anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave, I've anchored in Jesus, for he hath pow'r to save, I've anchored in the rock of ages.</p>
    <p class="verse">He keeps my soul from evil and gives me blessed peace, His voice hath stilled the waters and bid their tumult cease. My Pilot and Deliv'rer, to him I all confide, For always when I need him, he's at my side.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I've anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave, I've anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave, I've anchored in Jesus, for he hath pow'r to save, I've anchored in the rock of ages.</p>
    <p class="verse">He is my Friend and Saviour, in him my anchor's cast, He drives away my sorrows and shields me from the blast. By faith I'm looking upward beyond life's troubled sea, There I behold a haven prepared for me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I've anchored in Jesus, the storms of life I'll brave, I've anchored in Jesus, I fear no wind or wave, I've anchored in Jesus, for he hath pow'r to save, I've anchored in the rock of ages.</p>
