    <h1>Living By Faith</h1>
    <p class="verse">I care not today what the morrow may bring, If shadow or sunshine or rain, The Lord I know ruleth o&rsquo;er everything, And all of my worries are vain.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living by faith in Jesus above, Trusting, confiding in his great love; From all harm safe in his sheltering arm, I&rsquo;m living by faith and feel no alarm.</p>
    <p class="verse">Though tempests may blow and the storm clouds arise, Obscuring the brightness of life, I&rsquo;m never alarmed at the overcast skies; The Master looks on at the strife.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living by faith in Jesus above, Trusting, confiding in his great love; From all harm safe in his sheltering arm, I&rsquo;m living by faith and feel no alarm.</p>
    <p class="verse">I know that he safely will carry me through, No matter what evils betide; Why should I then care though the tempest may blow, If Jesus walks close to my side.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living by faith in Jesus above, Trusting, confiding in his great love; From all harm safe in his sheltering arm, I&rsquo;m living by faith and feel no alarm.</p>
    <p class="verse">Our Lord will return for his loved ones someday,Our troubles will then all be o&rsquo;er; The Master so gently will lead us away, Beyond that blest heavenly shore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Living by faith in Jesus above, Trusting, confiding in his great love; From all harm safe in his sheltering arm, I&rsquo;m living by faith and feel no alarm.</p>
