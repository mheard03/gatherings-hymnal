    <h1>My Plea</h1>
    <p class="verse">Should I at the gates of Heaven appear, To answer the challenge, &quot;What claim hast thou here?&quot; What hast thou to offer, yea, what is thy plea? With blessed assurance my answer would be,</p>
    <p class="chorus">All that I have is Jesus, All that I claim is Jesus, All that I want, All that I need, All that I plead is Jesus.</p>
    <p class="verse">Of all earthly treasures nothing I've brought, No great deeds of merit have I ever wrought. Though vile and unworthy as mortal could be, I've nothing to offer, but this is my plea,</p>
    <p class="chorus">All that I have is Jesus, All that I claim is Jesus, All that I want, All that I need, All that I plead is Jesus.</p>
    <p class="verse">My sins, they are many, my virtues are few, The blood of my Saviour will carry me through. When Christ in my place died on Calvary's tree, Hallelujah, that opened God's Heaven to me!</p>
    <p class="chorus">All that I have is Jesus, All that I claim is Jesus, All that I want, All that I need, All that I plead is Jesus.</p>
