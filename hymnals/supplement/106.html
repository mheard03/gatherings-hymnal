    <h1>Feeding On The Living Bread</h1>
    <p class="verse">We&rsquo;re feeding on the living bread, We&rsquo;re drinking at the fountainhead; And whosoever drinketh, Jesus said, Shall never, never thirst again. What, never thirst again? No, never thirst again! What, never thirst again? No, never thirst again! And whosoever drinketh, Jesus said, Shall never, never thirst again!</p>
    <p class="verse">We&rsquo;re calling on the living Lord, Calling on the one whose truth we've heard, And whosoever calleth, Jesus said, Shall ever have the life of God! What, have the life of God? Yes have the life of God! What, have the life of God? Yes have the life of God! And whosoever calleth, Jesus said, Shall ever have the life of God!</p>
    <p class="verse">We're abiding in the living vine, In Spirit tasting life divine, And whosoever 'bideth, Jesus said, Shall truly have the joy of God! What, have the joy of God? Yes, have the joy of God! What, have the joy of God? Yes, have the joy of God! And whosoever 'bideth, Jesus said, Shall truly have the joy of God!</p>
    <p class="verse">We're longing for our risen King, Who died and rose new life to bring, And if you will receive him you will sing, And live for evermore! What, live forevermore? Yes, live forevermore! What, live forevermore? Yes, live forevermore! And if you will receive him you will sing, And live for evermore!</p>
