    <h1>I Am So Glad Salvation&rsquo;s Free</h1>
    <p class="verse">I am so glad salvation&rsquo;s free to all who will receive it, Glad that the news was brought to me when I was lost and sad; Praise his dear name, I can proclaim that truly I believe it, For I am now his child, I know, and I&rsquo;m so glad.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glory, honor be to his name forever, Never a greater friend the sinful race has had; Love him, praise him, Jesus, the matchless Savior, He has redeemed this soul of mine, and I&rsquo;m so glad.</p>
    <p class="verse">I am so glad that I can tell to wayward souls the story, Glad that by grace from day to day a helper I may be; Finding delight in service true, my soul is winning glory, Glory for him who gave his life to rescue me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glory, honor be to his name forever, Never a greater friend the sinful race has had; Love him, praise him, Jesus, the matchless Savior, He has redeemed this soul of mine, and I&rsquo;m so glad.</p>
    <p class="verse">I am so glad that all my heart to Jesus I have given, Glad that at eventide my soul true sheaves to him may bring; I will be true until with all the happy throng in Heaven, Sweeter and nobler praise I give to Christ, my King.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Glory, honor be to his name forever, Never a greater friend the sinful race has had; Love him, praise him, Jesus, the matchless Savior, He has redeemed this soul of mine, and I&rsquo;m so glad.</p>
