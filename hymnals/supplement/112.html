    <h1>The Family of God</h1>
    <p class="intro">I'm so glad I'm a part of the fam'ly of God; I've been washed in the fountain, Cleansed by his blood! Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod, For I'm part of the fam'ly, the fam'ly of God.</p>
    <p class="verse">You will notice we say brother and sister 'round here, It's because we're a fam'ly and these folks are so dear, When one has a heartache we all share the tears, And rejoice in each vict'ry in this fam'ly so dear.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I'm so glad I'm a part of the fam'ly of God; I've been washed in the fountain, Cleansed by his blood! Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod, For I'm part of the fam'ly, the fam'ly of God.</p>
    <p class="verse">From the door of an orph'nage to the house of the King, No longer an outcast, a new song I sing; From rags unto riches, from the weak to the strong, I'm not worthy to be here, but praise God I belong!</p>
    <p class="chorus">I'm so glad I'm a part of the fam'ly of God; I've been washed in the fountain, Cleansed by his blood! Joint heirs with Jesus as we travel this sod, For I'm part of the fam'ly, the fam'ly of God.</p>
