    <h1>Neath The Old Olive Trees</h1>
    <p class="verse">'Neath the stars of the night walked the Saviour of light, In the garden of dew- ladened breeze; Where no light could be found, Jesus knelt on the ground, There he prayed 'neath the old olive trees.</p>
    <p class="chorus">'Neath the old olive trees, 'Neath the old olive trees, Went the Saviour alone on his knees: &quot;Not my will, thine be done,&quot; Cried the Father's own Son, As he knelt 'neath the old olive trees.</p>
    <p class="verse">All the sins of the world on our Lord would be hurled, So he knelt in the garden alone; Hear his soul-burdened plea, &quot;Let this cup pass from me, Even so, not my will, thine be done.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">'Neath the old olive trees, 'Neath the old olive trees, Went the Saviour alone on his knees: &quot;Not my will, thine be done,&quot; Cried the Father's own Son, As he knelt 'neath the old olive trees.</p>
    <p class="verse">May my song ever be of the love proffered me, By my Lord all alone on his knees: Praise his wonderful name, he who bore all my blame, As he knelt 'neath the old olive trees.</p>
    <p class="chorus">'Neath the old olive trees,'Neath the old olive trees, Went the Saviour alone on his knees: &quot;Not my will, thine be done,&quot; Cried the Father's own Son, As he knelt 'neath the old olive trees.</p>
