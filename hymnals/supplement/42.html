    <h1>That Will Be Heaven For Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">I know not the hour when my Lord will come To take me away to his own dear home; But I know that his presence will lighten the gloom, And that will be glory for me. And that will be glory for me, O, that will be glory for me! But I know that his presence will lighten the gloom, And that will be glory for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">I know not the song that the angels sing, I know not the sound of the harps&rsquo; glad ring; But I know there&rsquo;ll be mention of Jesus our king, And that will be music for me. And that will be music for me, O, that will be music for me! But I know there&rsquo;ll be mention of Jesus our king, And that will be music for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">I know not the form of my mansion fair, I know not the name that I then shall bear; But I know that my Savior will welcome me there, And that will be Heaven for me. And that will be Heaven for me, O, that will be Heaven for me. But I know that my Savior will welcome me there, And that will be Heaven for me.</p>
