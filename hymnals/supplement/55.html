    <h1>I&rsquo;ve Got A Mansion</h1>
    <p class="verse">I'm satisfied with just a cottage below, A little silver, and a little gold. But in that city, where the ransomed will shine, I want a gold one that's silver lined.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I've got a mansion just over the hilltop, In that bright land where we'll never grow old. And some day yonder we will never more wander, But walk the streets that are purest gold.</p>
    <p class="verse">Though often tempted, tormented and tested, And like the prophet, my pillow a stone, And though I find here, no permanent dwelling, I know he'll give me a mansion my own.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I've got a mansion just over the hilltop, In that bright land where we'll never grow old. And some day yonder we will never more wander, But walk the streets that are purest gold.</p>
    <p class="verse">Don't think me poor or deserted or lonely, I'm not discouraged, I'm heaven bound. I'm just a pilgrim in search of that city, I want a mansion, a harp and a crown.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I've got a mansion just over the hilltop, In that bright land where we'll never grow old. And some day yonder we will never more wander, But walk the streets that are purest gold.</p>
