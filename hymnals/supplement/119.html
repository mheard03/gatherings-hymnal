    <h1>A Sinner Like Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">I was once far away from the Savior, And as vile as a sinner could be, I wondered if Christ the Redeemer, Could save a poor sinner like me.</p>
    <p class="verse">I wandered on in the darkness, Not a ray of light I could see, And the thought filled my heart with sadness, There&rsquo;s no help for a sinner like me.</p>
    <p class="verse">And then, in that dark, lonely hour, A voice sweetly whispered to me, Saying Christ the Redeemer has power To save a poor sinner like me.</p>
    <p class="verse">I listened, and lo! &rsquo;twas the Savior That was speaking so kindly to me; I cried, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the chief of sinners; Oh, save a poor sinner like me.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="verse">I then fully trusted in Jesus; And oh, what a joy came to me: My heart was filled with his praises, For saving a sinner like me.</p>
    <p class="verse">No longer in darkness I&rsquo;m walking, For the light is now shining on me; And now unto others I&rsquo;m telling, How he saved a poor sinner like me.</p>
    <p class="verse">And when life&rsquo;s journey is over, And I the dear Savior shall see, I&rsquo;ll praise him forever and ever, For saving a sinner like me.</p>
