    <h1>Stand By Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">When the storms of life are raging, Stand by me (stand by me); When the storms of life are raging, Stand by me (stand by me); When the world is tossing me, Like a ship upon the sea, Thou who rulest wind and water, Stand by me (stand by me);</p>
    <p class="verse">In the midst of tribulation, Stand by me (stand by me); In the midst of tribulation, Stand by me (stand by me); When the hosts of hell assail, And my strength begins to fail, Thou who never lost a battle, Stand by me (stand by me);</p>
    <p class="verse">In the midst of faults and failures, Stand by me (stand by me); In the midst of faults and failures, Stand by me (stand by me); When I do the best I can, And my friends misunderstand, Thou who knowest all about me, Stand by me (stand by me).</p>
    <p class="verse">In the midst of persecution, Stand by me (stand by me); In the midst of persecution, Stand by me (stand by me); When my foes in battle array Undertake to stop my way, Thou who saved Paul and Silas, Stand by me (stand by me);</p>
    <p class="verse">When I&rsquo;m growing old and feeble, Stand by me (stand by me); When I&rsquo;m growing old and feeble, Stand by me (stand by me); When my life becomes a burd'n, And I&rsquo;m nearing chilly Jord'n, O thou &ldquo;Lily of the Valley,&rdquo; Stand by me (stand by me);</p>
