    <h1>In God&rsquo;s Green Pastures</h1>
    <p class="verse">In God&rsquo;s green pastures feeding by his cool waters lie; Soft in the evening walk my Lord and I, All the sheep of his pasture fare so wondrously fine;His sheep am I.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sisters: Waters cool, Brothers: In the valley; Sisters: Pastures green, Brothers: On the mountain, Sisters: In the evening Brothers: In the evening All: Walk my Lord and I. Sisters: Dark the night, Brothers: In the valley, Sisters: Rough the way, Brothers: On the mountain, Sisters: Step by step Brothers: Step by step, All: My Lord and I.</p>
    <p class="verse">Thro' the streets of the city in the darkness of night,Far from the fold, he heard my lonely cry. Now I sit at his table in the palace of light; His sheep am I.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sisters: Waters cool, Brothers: In the valley; Sisters: Pastures green, Brothers: On the mountain, Sisters: In the evening Brothers: In the evening All: Walk my Lord and I. Sisters: Dark the night, Brothers: In the valley, Sisters: Rough the way, Brothers: On the mountain, Sisters: Step by step Brothers: Step by step, All: My Lord and I.</p>
    <p class="verse">God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all, O how we love within his presence to dwell. In this light we enjoy a constant cleansing within, From every sin.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Sisters: In the light, Brothers: We are walking Sisters: Fellowship, Brothers: We're enjoying, Sisters: And the blood, Brothers: Of God's son, All: Is cleansing us from sin. Sisters: We confess, Brothers: He is faithful, Sisters: To forgive, Brothers: He is righteous, Sisters: What a joy, Brothers: We are cleansed, All: From every sin.</p>
