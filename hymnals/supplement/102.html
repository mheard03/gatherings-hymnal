    <h1>God Holds The Future</h1>
    <p class="verse">Dread not the things that are ahead, The burdens great, the sinking sands, The thorns that o&rsquo;er the path are spread, God holds the future in his hands.</p>
    <p class="chorus">God holds the future in his hands And every heart he understands. On him depend, he is your friend: He holds the future in his hands.</p>
    <p class="verse">We know not what tomorrow hides, Of sun or storm or good or ill; We only know his dear hand guides, And he will be our father still.</p>
    <p class="chorus">God holds the future in his hands And every heart he understands. On him depend, he is your friend: He holds the future in his hands.</p>
    <p class="verse">His hand created earth and sky, The zephyrs and the storms that rage, And years to come and years gone by To him are but an open page.</p>
    <p class="chorus">God holds the future in his hands And every heart he understands. On him depend, he is your friend: He holds the future in his hands.</p>
    <p class="verse">Live close to him and trust his love, Assured that while on earth we roam, Whate&rsquo;er may come, he bends above To guide his children safely home.</p>
    <p class="chorus">God holds the future in his hands And every heart he understands. On him depend, he is your friend: He holds the future in his hands.</p>
