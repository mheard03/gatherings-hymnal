    <h1>The Touch of His Hand On Mine</h1>
    <p class="verse">There are days so dark that I seek in vain For the face of my friend divine; But tho' darkness hide, he is there to guide By the touch of his hand on mine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, the touch of his hand on mine, (on mine) Oh, the touch of his hand on mine! (on mine) There is grace and pow&rsquo;r, in the trying hour, In the touch of his hand on mine.</p>
    <p class="verse">There are times, when tired of the toilsome road,That for ways of the world I pine; But he draws me back to the upward track By the touch of his hand on mine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, the touch of his hand on mine, (on mine) Oh, the touch of his hand on mine! (on mine) There is grace and pow&rsquo;r, in the trying hour, In the touch of his hand on mine.</p>
    <p class="verse">When the way is dim, and I cannot see Thro' the mist of his wise design, How my glad heart yearns and my faith returns By the touch of his hand on mine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, the touch of his hand on mine, (on mine) Oh, the touch of his hand on mine! (on mine) There is grace and pow&rsquo;r, in the trying hour, In the touch of his hand on mine.</p>
    <p class="verse">In the last sad hour, as I stand alone Where the powers of death combine, While the dark waves roll he will guide my soul By the touch of his hand on mine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, the touch of his hand on mine, (on mine) Oh, the touch of his hand on mine! (on mine) There is grace and pow&rsquo;r, in the trying hour, In the touch of his hand on mine.</p>
