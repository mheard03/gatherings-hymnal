    <h1>He Brought Me Out</h1>
    <p class="verse">My heart was distressed &rsquo;neath Jehovah&rsquo;s dread frown, And low in the pit where my sins dragged me down; I cried to the Lord from the deep miry clay, Who tenderly brought me out to golden day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He brought me out of the miry clay, He set my feet on the Rock to stay; He puts a song in my soul today, A song of praise, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="verse">He placed me upon the strong Rock by his side, My steps were established and here I&rsquo;ll abide; No danger of falling while here I remain, But stand by his grace until the crown I gain.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He brought me out of the miry clay, He set my feet on the Rock to stay; He puts a song in my soul today, A song of praise, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="verse">He gave me a song, &rsquo;twas a new song of praise; By day and by night its sweet notes I will raise; My heart&rsquo;s overflowing, I&rsquo;m happy and free; I&rsquo;ll praise my Redeemer, who has rescued me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He brought me out of the miry clay, He set my feet on the Rock to stay; He puts a song in my soul today, A song of praise, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;ll sing of his wonderful mercy to me, I&rsquo;ll praise him till all men his goodness shall see; I&rsquo;ll sing of salvation at home and abroad, Till many shall hear the truth and trust in God.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He brought me out of the miry clay, He set my feet on the Rock to stay; He puts a song in my soul today, A song of praise, hallelujah!</p>
    <p class="verse">I&rsquo;ll tell of the pit, with its gloom and despair, I&rsquo;ll praise the dear Father, who answered my prayer; I&rsquo;ll sing my new song, the glad story of love, Then join in the chorus with the saints above.</p>
    <p class="chorus">He brought me out of the miry clay, He set my feet on the Rock to stay; He puts a song in my soul today, A song of praise, hallelujah!</p>
