    <h1>Psalm 19 -- The Law of the Lord</h1>
    <p class="verse">The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.</p>
    <p class="chorus">More to be desired are they than gold, Yea, than much fine gold: Sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.</p>
    <p class="verse">The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.</p>
    <p class="chorus">More to be desired are they than gold, Yea, than much fine gold: Sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb.</p>
    <p class="verse">The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever: The judgments of the Lord are true, and righteous altogether.</p>
    <p class="chorus">More to be desired are they than gold, Yea, than much fine gold: Sweeter also than honey, and the honeycomb. More over by them is thy servant warned, is thy servant warned: And in keeping of them there is great reward.</p>
