    <h1>Thank God For The Blood</h1>
    <p class="verse">In sin I wandered sore and sad With bleeding heart and aching head, Till Jesus came and sweetly said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take thy sins away.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood That washes white as snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">I gave my heart, my life, my all To him who drank the cup of gall To raise the guilty from the fall And take their sins away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood That washes white as snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">The water, Spirit and the blood Agree, if we but understood, In making sinners pure and good, And take our sins away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood That washes white as snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">How wonderful God&rsquo;s mighty plan! How grace the awful guilt did span When he took on the form of man To take our sins away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood That washes white as snow.</p>
    <p class="verse">We cannot know, we may not tell How we are saved from death and hell; Thro&rsquo; faith we know that all is well, He took our sins away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood! Thank God for the blood, That washes white as snow.</p>
