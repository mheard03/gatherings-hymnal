    <h1>Deeper Than the Stain</h1>
    <p class="verse">Dark the stain that soiled man's nature, Long the distance that he fell. Far removed from hope and heaven, Into deep despair and hell. But there was a fountain opened, And the blood of God's own Son, Purifies the soul and reaches Deeper than the stain has gone!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord for full salvation, God still reigns upon his throne. And I know the blood still reaches Deeper than the stain has gone.</p>
    <p class="verse">Conscious of the deep pollution, Sinners wander in the night, Tho' they hear the Shepherd calling, They still fear to face the light. This the blessed consolation, That can melt the heart of stone, That sweet Balm of Gilead reaches Deeper than the stain has gone!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord for full salvation, God still reigns upon his throne. And I know the blood still reaches Deeper than the stain has gone.</p>
    <p class="verse">All unworthy we who've wandered, And our eyes are wet with tears; As we think of love that sought us Through the weary wasted years. Yet we walk the holy highway, Walking by God's grace alone Knowing Calv'ry's fountain reaches Deeper than the stain has gone!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord for full salvation, God still reigns upon his throne. And I know the blood still reaches Deeper than the stain has gone.</p>
    <p class="verse">When with holy choirs we're standing In the presence of the King, And our souls are lost in wonder, While the white-robed choirs sing; Then we'll praise the name of Jesus, With the millions round the throne; Praise him for the pow'r that reaches Deeper than the stain has gone!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Praise the Lord for full salvation, God still reigns upon his throne. And I know the blood still reaches Deeper than the stain has gone.</p>
