    <h1>Covered By the Blood</h1>
    <p class="verse">Once in sin&rsquo;s darkest night I was wand&rsquo;ring alone; A stranger to mercy I stood. But the Savior came nigh when he heard my faint cry, And he put my sins under the blood.</p>
    <p class="chorus">They are covered by the blood; They are covered by the blood; My sins are all covered by the blood. Mine iniquities so vast have been blotted out at last, My sins are all covered by the blood.</p>
    <p class="verse">From the burden I carried now I am set free, For Jesus has lifted my load. O the love and the grace I received in its place, When he put my sins under the blood.</p>
    <p class="chorus">They are covered by the blood; They are covered by the blood; My sins are all covered by the blood. Mine iniquities so vast have been blotted out at last, My sins are all covered by the blood.</p>
    <p class="verse">I can ne&rsquo;er understand why he sought even me, Why his lifeblood on Calvary flowed. But sufficient for me, since he died on the tree, He hath put my sins under the blood.</p>
    <p class="chorus">They are covered by the blood; They are covered by the blood; My sins are all covered by the blood. Mine iniquities so vast have been blotted out at last, My sins are all covered by the blood.</p>
    <p class="verse">Now he comes to my heart and removes ev&rsquo;ry care; He bears all my cumbering load. In a pathway replete with his love are my feet, Since he put my sins under the blood.</p>
    <p class="chorus">They are covered by the blood; They are covered by the blood; My sins are all covered by the blood. Mine iniquities so vast have been blotted out at last, My sins are all covered by the blood.</p>
