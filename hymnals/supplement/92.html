    <h1>I Have Found a Hiding Place</h1>
    <p class="verse">I have found a hiding place when sore distrest, Jesus Rock of Ages, strong and true; In a weary land I in his shadow rest, He is my strength in all that I do.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Rock of Ages, let me hide in thee; Jesus, Rose of Sharon, sweet thou art to me; Lily of the Valley, Bright and Morning Star, Fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have found the sweetest flower that ever grew, Jesus, Rose of Sharon, fair and pure; He's my joy and comfort, blessed friend so true, He blooms within my heart evermore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Rock of Ages, let me hide in thee; Jesus, Rose of Sharon, sweet thou art to me; Lily of the Valley, Bright and Morning Star, Fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">I have found a lovely star that shines on high, Jesus, bright and morning star to me; In the night of sorrow he is ever nigh, He drives the darkest shadows away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, Rock of Ages, let me hide in thee; Jesus, Rose of Sharon, sweet thou art to me; Lily of the Valley, Bright and Morning Star, Fairest of ten thousand to my soul.</p>
