    <h1>Jesus Hold My Hand</h1>
    <p class="verse">As I travel through this pilgrim land There is a friend who walks with me, Leads me safely through the sinking sand, It is the Christ of Calvary; This would be my prayer, dear Lord, each day, To help me do the best I can, For I need thy light to guide me day and night, Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, hold my hand, I need thee every hour, Through this pilgrim land Protect me by thy power; Hear my feeble plea, O Lord, look down on me, When I kneel in prayer I know I'll meet you there, Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.</p>
    <p class="verse">Let me travel in the light divine That I may see the blessed way; Keep me that I may be wholly thine And sing redemption's song each day; I will be a soldier brave and true And ever firmly take a stand, As I onward go and daily meet the foe, Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, hold my hand, I need thee every hour, Through this pilgrim land Protect me by thy power; Hear my feeble plea, O Lord, look down on me, When I kneel in prayer I know I'll meet you there, Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.</p>
    <p class="verse">When I wander through the valley dim Toward the setting of the sun, Lead me safely to a land of rest When I the crown of life have won; I have put my faith in thee, dear Lord, That I may reach the golden strand, There's no other friend on whom I can depend, Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Jesus, hold my hand, I need thee every hour, Through this pilgrim land Protect me by thy power; Hear my feeble plea, O Lord, look down on me, When I kneel in prayer I know I'll meet you there, Blessed Jesus, hold my hand.</p>
