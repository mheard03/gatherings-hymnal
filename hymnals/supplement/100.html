    <h1>The Old-Fashioned Meeting</h1>
    <p class="verse">O how well I remember in the old- fashioned days, When some old- fashioned people had some old-fashioned ways; In the old-fashioned meetings, as they tarried there. In the old-fashioned manner, how God answered their prayer.</p>
    <p class="chorus">'Twas an old-fashioned meeting in an old- fashioned place, Where some old- fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace: As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray, And God heard me and saved me in the old-fashioned way.</p>
    <p class="verse">There was singing, such singing in those old-fashioned airs! There was power, such power in those old-fashioned prayers. An old-fashioned conviction made the sinner pray, And the Lord heard and saved him in the old-fashioned way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">'Twas an old-fashioned meeting in an old- fashioned place, Where some old- fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace: As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray, And God heard me and saved me in the old-fashioned way.</p>
    <p class="verse">If the Lord never changes, as the fashions of men, If he's always the same, why, he's old-fashioned then! As an old-fashioned Christian I will dare to say, That I like it far better in the old-fashioned way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">'Twas an old-fashioned meeting in an old- fashioned place, Where some old- fashioned people had some old-fashioned grace: As an old-fashioned sinner I began to pray, And God heard me and saved me in the old-fashioned way.</p>
