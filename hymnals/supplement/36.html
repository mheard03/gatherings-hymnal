    <h1>Christ Paid a Debt</h1>
    <p class="verse">For years my life was lost in sin, No friends without no joy within, I knew of nothing but misery and pain. But then I heard about a man Named Jesus dying for my sin, He had the answer to take my sin away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Christ paid a debt he did not owe, I owed a debt I could not pay, I needed someone to wash my sins away, And now I'm singing this new song, Amazing grace, 'Cause Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay.</p>
    <p class="verse">He paid my debt at Calvary, He cleansed my soul and set me free, I'm glad that Jesus did all my sins erase. Who is a God like unto thee, Forgiving all iniquity? Christ Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Christ paid a debt he did not owe, I owed a debt I could not pay, I needed someone to wash my sins away, And now I'm singing this new song, Amazing grace, 'Cause Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay.</p>
    <p class="verse">Now fears of life around me fly, And troubles seem to draw so nigh, I know it can't be as long as it may seem, Those pearly gates I now can see, Those streets of gold awaiting me, 'Cause Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Christ paid a debt he did not owe, I owed a debt I could not pay, I needed someone to wash my sins away, And now I'm singing this new song, Amazing grace, 'Cause Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay.</p>
    <p class="verse">One day he's coming back for me, I'll live with him eternally, Won't it be glory to see him on that day! Now I rejoice in Christ my Lord, I'll sing his praise forevermore, Because he paid the debt that I could never pay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Christ paid a debt he did not owe, I owed a debt I could not pay, I needed someone to wash my sins away, And now I'm singing this new song, Amazing grace, 'Cause Jesus paid the debt that I could never pay.</p>
