    <h1>Harvest Time</h1>
    <p class="verse">The seed I have scattered in springtime with weeping, And watered with tears and with dews from on high; Another may shout when the harvester&rsquo;s reaping, Shall gather my grain in the &ldquo;sweet by and by.&rdquo;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Over and over, yes, deeper and deeper My heart is pierced through with life&rsquo;s sorrowing cry, But the tears of the sower and the songs of the reaper Shall mingle together in joy by and by.</p>
    <p class="verse">Another may reap what in springtime I&rsquo;ve planted, Another rejoice in the fruit of my pain, Not knowing my tears when in summer I fainted While toiling sad-hearted in sunshine and rain.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Over and over, yes, deeper and deeper My heart is pierced through with life&rsquo;s sorrowing cry, But the tears of the sower and the songs of the reaper Shall mingle together in joy by and by.</p>
    <p class="verse">The thorns will have choked and the summer sun blasted The most of the seed which in springtime I&rsquo;ve sown; But the Lord who has watched while my weary toil lasted Will give me a harvest for what I have done.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Over and over, yes, deeper and deeper My heart is pierced through with life&rsquo;s sorrowing cry, But the tears of the sower and the songs of the reaper Shall mingle together in joy by and by.</p>
