    <h1>My Sins Are Gone</h1>
    <p class="verse">You ask me why I'm happy so I'll just tell you why, Because my sins are gone; And when I meet the scoffers who ask me where they are, I say, my sins are gone!</p>
    <p class="chorus">They're underneath the blood, on the cross of Calvary, As far removed as darkness is from dawn; In the sea of God's forgetfulness, That's good enough for me, Praise God, my sins are gone.</p>
    <p class="verse">Twas at the old-time altar where God came in my heart, And now my sins are gone; The Lord took full possession, the devil did depart, I'm glad my sins are gone!</p>
    <p class="chorus">They're underneath the blood, on the cross of Calvary, As far removed as darkness is from dawn; In the sea of God's forgetfulness, That's good enough for me, Praise God, my sins are gone.</p>
    <p class="verse">I'm glad my sins are gone! When Satan comes to tempt me and tries to make me doubt, I say, &quot;My sins are gone, You got me into trouble but Jesus got me out.&quot; I'm glad my sins are gone!</p>
    <p class="chorus">They're underneath the blood, on the cross of Calvary, As far removed as darkness is from dawn; In the sea of God's forgetfulness, That's good enough for me, Praise God, my sins are gone.</p>
    <p class="verse">I'm living now for Jesus, I'm happy night and day, Because my sins are gone; My soul is filled with music, with all my heart I say, &quot;I know&quot; my sins are gone!</p>
    <p class="chorus">They're underneath the blood, on the cross of Calvary, As far removed as darkness is from dawn; In the sea of God's forgetfulness, That's good enough for me, Praise God, my sins are gone.</p>
