    <h1>We Will Understand It Better By and By</h1>
    <p class="verse">Trials dark on every hand, and we cannot understand All the ways that God would lead us to that blessed Promised Land; But he guides us with his eye, and we'll follow till we die, For we'll understand it better by and by.</p>
    <p class="chorus">By and by, when the morning comes, When the saints of God are gathered home, We will tell the story how we've overcome, For we'll understand it better by and by. [by and by]</p>
    <p class="verse">Some are living destitute of the things that life demands, Want of food and want of shelter, thirsty hills and barren lands; But we're trusting in the Lord, and according to God's word, We will understand it better by and by.</p>
    <p class="chorus">By and by, when the morning comes, When the saints of God are gathered home, We will tell the story how we've overcome, For we'll understand it better by and by. [by and by]</p>
    <p class="verse">Oft our cherished plans have failed, disappointments have prevailed, And we've wandered in the darkness heavy hearted and alone. In that land of perfect day, when the mists are rolled away, We will understand it better by and by.</p>
    <p class="chorus">By and by, when the morning comes, When the saints of God are gathered home, We will tell the story how we've overcome, For we'll understand it better by and by. [by and by]</p>
    <p class="verse">Temptations, hidden snares often take us unawares, And our hearts are made to bleed for some tho't-less word or deed; And we wonder why the test when we try to do our best, But we'll understand it better by and by.</p>
    <p class="chorus">By and by, when the morning comes, When the saints of God are gathered home, We will tell the story how we've overcome, For we'll understand it better by and by. [by and by]</p>
