    <h1>Farther Along</h1>
    <p class="verse">Tempted and tried, we're oft made to wonder, Why it should be thus all the day long; While there are others living about us, Never molested, though in the wrong.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Farther along we&rsquo;ll know all about it, Farther along we&rsquo;ll understand why; Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine, We&rsquo;ll understand it all by and by.</p>
    <p class="verse">Faithful till death,&rdquo; saith our loving Master; A few more years to labor and wait; Toils of the road will then seem as nothing, As we sweep through the beautiful gate.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Farther along we&rsquo;ll know all about it, Farther along we&rsquo;ll understand why; Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine, We&rsquo;ll understand it all by and by.</p>
    <p class="verse">When we see Jesus coming in glory, Gather us to him up in the sky; Then we shall meet him and praise him ever, We&rsquo;ll understand it all by and by.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Farther along we&rsquo;ll know all about it, Farther along we&rsquo;ll understand why; Cheer up, my brother, live in the sunshine, We&rsquo;ll understand it all by and by.</p>
