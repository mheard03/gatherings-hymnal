    <h1>His Love Hath No Limit</h1>
    <p class="verse">He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater, He sendeth more strength when the labors increase;To added affliction he addeth his mercy; To multiplied trials, his multiplied peace.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His love hath no limit; his grace hath no measure. His pow'r hath no boundary known unto men; For out of his infinite riches in Jesus, He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again!</p>
    <p class="verse">When we have exhausted our store of endurance, When our strength hath failed ere the day is half done, When we reach the end of our hoarded resources, Our Father's full giving is only begun.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His love hath no limit; his grace hath no measure. His pow'r hath no boundary known unto men; For out of his infinite riches in Jesus, He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again!</p>
    <p class="verse">Fear not that thy need shall exceed his provision, Our God ever yearns his resources to share; Lean hard on the arm everlasting, availing; The Father both thee and thy load will upbear.</p>
    <p class="chorus">His love hath no limit; his grace hath no measure. His pow'r hath no boundary known unto men; For out of his infinite riches in Jesus, He giveth, and giveth, and giveth again!</p>
