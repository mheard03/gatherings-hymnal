    <h1>When Jesus Comes</h1>
    <p class="verse">One sat alone beside the highway begging, His eyes were blind, the light he could not see; He clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows, Then Jesus came and bade his darkness flee.</p>
    <p class="chorus">When Jesus comes the tempter&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.</p>
    <p class="verse">From home and friends the evil spirits drove him, Among the tombs he dwelt in misery; He cut himself as demon pow&rsquo;rs possessed him, Then Jesus came and set the captive free.</p>
    <p class="chorus">When Jesus comes the tempter&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.</p>
    <p class="verse">Unclean! Unclean!&rdquo; the leper cried in torment, The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness stood near; The fever raged, disease had gripped its victim, Then Jesus came and cast out every fear.</p>
    <p class="chorus">When Jesus comes the tempter&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.</p>
    <p class="verse">Their hearts were sad as in the tomb they laid him, For death had come and taken him away; Their night was dark and bitter tears were falling, Then Jesus came and night was turned to day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">When Jesus comes the tempter&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.</p>
    <p class="verse">So men today have found the Savior able, They could not conquer passion, lust and sin; Their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely, Then Jesus came and dwelt, himself, within.</p>
    <p class="chorus">When Jesus comes the tempter&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r is broken; When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away. He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory, For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.</p>
