    <h1>Holy Is The Lord</h1>
    <p class="verse">Holy, holy, holy is the Lord! Sing, O ye people, gladly adore him, Let the mountains tremble at his word, Let the hills be joyful before him; Mighty in wisdom, boundless in mercy, Great is Jehovah, King over all.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, Let the hills be joyful before him.</p>
    <p class="verse">Praise him, praise him! Shout aloud for joy, Watchman of Zion, herald the story; Sin and death his kingdom shall destroy, All the earth shall sing of his glory; Praise him ye angels, ye who behold him Robed in his splendor, matchless, divine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, Let the hills be joyful before him.</p>
    <p class="verse">King Eternal, blessed be his name! So may his children gladly adore him; When in heav'n we join the happy strain, When we cast our bright crowns before him; There in his likeness joyful awaking, There we shall see him, there we shall sing.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Holy, holy, holy is the Lord, Let the hills be joyful before him.</p>
