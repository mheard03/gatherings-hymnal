    <h1>This World Is Not My Home</h1>
    <p class="verse">This world is not my home, I'm just a passin' thro', My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue, The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O Lord, you know, I have no friend like you, If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</p>
    <p class="verse">They're all expecting me, and that's one thing I know, My Savior pardoned me, and now I onward go, I know he'll take me thro', tho' I am weak and poor, And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O Lord, you know, I have no friend like you, If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</p>
    <p class="verse">Just up in glory-land I'll live eternally, The saints on every hand are shouting victory. Their song of sweetest praise drifts back from heaven's shore, And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O Lord, you know, I have no friend like you, If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckon me from heaven's open door, And I can't feel at home in this world anymore.</p>
