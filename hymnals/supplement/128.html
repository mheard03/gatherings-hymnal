    <h1>The Camel Train</h1>
    <p class="verse">&rsquo;Twas a day in early springtime, By an ancient wayside well, Eliezer paused to rest his camel train. He had found a bride for Isaac, Ere the evening shadows fell, For his weary journey had not been in vain.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall. Don&rsquo;t you hear the Eliezer call? There&rsquo;s going to be a wedding, And our joy will soon begin, In the evening when the camel train comes in.</p>
    <p class="verse">So he took the fair Rebekah, Dressed in jewels rich and rare, Back to Abraham and Isaac far away. Where Rebekah loved her Isaac, And he loved Rebekah fair; Oh, it must have been a happy wedding day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall. Don&rsquo;t you hear the Eliezer call? There&rsquo;s going to be a wedding, And our joy will soon begin, In the evening when the camel train comes in.</p>
    <p class="verse">Now the blessed Holy Spirit, From our Father God above, Has come down to earth to find a worthy bride. For our Isaac over yonder Has prepared his tents of love, And he wants his fair Rebekah by his side.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall. Don&rsquo;t you hear the Eliezer call? There&rsquo;s going to be a wedding, And our joy will soon begin, In the evening when the camel train comes in.</p>
    <p class="verse">We have left our kinfolk gladly; We have bidd'n the world goodbye. We&rsquo;ve been called to be his pure and spotless bride; Where we&rsquo;ll soon behold our Jesus In that blest eternity; What a happy, happy wedding that will be!</p>
    <p class="chorus">Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall. Don&rsquo;t you hear the Eliezer call? There&rsquo;s going to be a wedding, And our joy will soon begin, In the evening when the camel train comes in.</p>
