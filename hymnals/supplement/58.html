    <h1>I Am Waiting For the Dawning</h1>
    <p class="verse">I am waiting for the dawning Of that bright and glorious day, When the darksome night of sorrow Shall have vanished far away; When forever with the Saviour, Far beyond this vale of tears, I shall swell the hymn of worship Through the everlasting years.</p>
    <p class="verse">I am looking at the brightness, See, it shineth from afar, Of the clear and joyous beaming, Of the Bright and Morning Star; Through the dark grey mist of morning I behold its glorious light; Then away with every shadow Of this sad and weary night.</p>
    <p class="verse">I am waiting for the coming Of the Lord who died for me; Oh, his words have thrilled my spirit, &quot;I will come again for thee.&quot; I can almost hear his footfall On the threshold of the door, And my heart, my heart is longing To be with him evermore.</p>
