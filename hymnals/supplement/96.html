    <h1>He Washed My Eyes With Tears</h1>
    <p class="verse">He washed my eyes with tears that I might see, The broken heart I had was good for me; He tore it all apart and looked inside, He found it full of fear and foolish pride. He swept away the things that made me blind, And then I saw the clouds were silver lined; And now I understand 'twas best for me,</p>
    <p class="verse">He washed my eyes with tears that I might see. He washed my eyes with tears that I might see, The glory of himself revealed to me; I did not know that he had wounded hands, I saw the blood he spilt upon the sands. I saw the marks of shame and wept and cried, He was my substitute, for me he died. And now I'm glad he came so tenderly, And washed my eyes with tears that I might see.</p>
