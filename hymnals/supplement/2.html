    <h1>Come Ye Sinners</h1>
    <p class="verse">Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched, weak and wounded, sick and sore; Jesus ready stands to save you, full of pity, love and power; He is able, he is able, he is willing, doubt no more; He is able, he is able, he is willing, doubt no more;</p>
    <p class="verse">Ho, ye needy, come and welcome, God's free bounty glorify; True belief and true repentance, every grace that brings us nigh, Without money, without money, come to Jesus Christ and buy. Without money, without money, come to Jesus Christ and buy.</p>
    <p class="verse">Let not conscience make you linger, nor of fitness fondly dream; All the fitness he requireth is to feel your need of him; This he gives you, this he gives you; 'tis the Spirit's rising beam. This he gives you, this he gives you; 'tis the Spirit's rising beam.</p>
    <p class="verse">Come, ye weary, heavy laden, lost and ruined by the fall; If you tarry till you're better, you will never come at all. Not the righteous, not the righteous, sinners Jesus came to call. Not the righteous, not the righteous, sinners Jesus came to call.</p>
    <p class="verse">Agonizing in the garden, lo! your Maker prostrate lies; On the bloody tree behold him; hear him cry, before he dies, &quot;It is finished, it is finished!&quot; Sinner, will not this suffice? &quot;It is finished, it is finished!&quot; Sinner, will not this suffice?</p>
    <p class="verse">Lo! The incarnate God, ascended, pleads the merits of his blood; Venture on him, venture wholly, let no other trust intrude; None but Jesus, none but Jesus can do helpless sinners good. None but Jesus, none but Jesus can do helpless sinners good.</p>
    <p class="verse">Saints and angels joined in concert, sing the praises of the Lamb; While the blissful seats of heaven sweetly echo with his name; Hallelujah, Hallelujah! Sinners here may do the same. Hallelujah, Hallelujah! Sinners here may do the same.</p>
