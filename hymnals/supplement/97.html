    <h1>I Want That Mountain</h1>
    <p class="verse">I saw the giant of Prayerlessness upon the mountain high; He laughed so hard at my unbended knee. No longer in the wilderness, I'll stay, and so I cry: I want that mountain, it belongs to me!</p>
    <p class="chorus">I want that mountain! I want that mountain! Where the milk and honey flow, Where the grapes of Eshcol grow, I want that mountain! I want that mountain! The mountain that my Lord has given me.</p>
    <p class="verse">There was a giant of Laziness who said I wouldn't go And witness for the one who set me free. I'll come from out the wilderness, I'll witness now I know; I want that mountain, it belongs to me!</p>
    <p class="chorus">I want that mountain! I want that mountain! Where the milk and honey flow, Where the grapes of Eshcol grow, I want that mountain! I want that mountain! The mountain that my Lord has given me.</p>
    <p class="verse">One faithless giant upon the crest of Hebron's lofty height Has vowed that he's the one to make me flee. I'll climb from out the wilderness and trust Jehovah's might! I want that mountain, it belongs to me!</p>
    <p class="chorus">I want that mountain! I want that mountain! Where the milk and honey flow, Where the grapes of Eshcol grow, I want that mountain! I want that mountain! The mountain that my Lord has given me.</p>
    <p class="verse">Let every giant of distress and unbelief and sin Get ready now to vacate, for you see: I've come from out the wilderness! I know I'm going to win! I want that mountain, it belongs to me!</p>
    <p class="chorus">I want that mountain! I want that mountain! Where the milk and honey flow, Where the grapes of Eshcol grow, I want that mountain! I want that mountain! The mountain that my Lord has given me.</p>
