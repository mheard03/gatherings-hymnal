    <h1>So Send I You, By Grace</h1>
    <p class="verse">So send I, you, by grace made strong to triumph, O'er hosts of hell, o'er darkness, death and sin, My name to bear, and in that name to conquer, So send I you, my victory to win.</p>
    <p class="verse">So send I you, to take to souls in bondage, The word of truth that sets the captive free, To break the bonds of sin, to loose death's fetters, So send I you, to bring the lost to me.</p>
    <p class="verse">So send I you, my strength to know in weakness, My joy in grief, my perfect peace in pain. To prove my power, my grace, my promised presence, So send I you, eternal fruit to gain.</p>
    <p class="verse">So send I you, in sorrow, yet rejoicing, As poor in store, yet boundless wealth to give, As having naught, and yet possessing all things. So send I you, the life of heav'n to live.</p>
    <p class="verse">So send I you, to bear my cross with patience, And then one day with joy to lay it down. To hear my voice, well, done, my faithful servant, Come share my throne, my kingdom and my crown.</p>
