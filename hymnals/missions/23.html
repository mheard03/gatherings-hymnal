    <h1>No Man Careth for my Soul</h1>
    <p class="verse">Far away on distant shores many souls are in despair, For their hearts are lost and weighted down with sin. And their tear stained faces seek for relief from all their care, Persecution from without and fear within.</p>
    <p class="chorus">&quot;No man careth for my soul,&quot; thus cry the millions, &quot;No man careth for my soul.&quot; Oh, hear their plea. Won't you give your life today to spread the gospel? So that Christ can save their souls and set them free.</p>
    <p class="verse">Poor lost souls with blinded eyes, grope about in sin's dark night, Kneeling down before their gods of wood and stone. Can we see them dying there, still denied the gospel light, Let them go into eternity alone?</p>
    <p class="chorus">&quot;No man careth for my soul,&quot; thus cry the millions, &quot;No man careth for my soul.&quot; Oh, hear their plea. Won't you give your life today to spread the gospel? So that Christ can save their souls and set them free.</p>
