    <h1>Is Your All on the Altar?</h1>
    <p class="verse">You have longed for sweet peace and for faith to increase, And have earnestly, fervently prayed. But you cannot have rest or be perfectly blest, Until all on the altar is laid.</p>
    <p class="chorus">ls your all on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? You can only be blest, and have peace and sweet rest, As you yield him your body and soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">Would you walk with the Lord in the light of his word, And have peace and contentment alway? You must do his sweet will to be free from all ill, On the altar your all you must lay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">ls your all on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? You can only be blest, and have peace and sweet rest, As you yield him your body and soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">O, we never can know what the Lord will bestow, Of the blessings for which we have prayed, Till our body and soul he doth fully control, And our all on the altar is laid.</p>
    <p class="chorus">ls your all on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? You can only be blest, and have peace and sweet rest, As you yield him your body and soul.</p>
    <p class="verse">Who can tell all the love, he will send from above, And how happy our hearts will be made, Of the fellowship sweet we shall share at his feet, When our all on the altar is laid.</p>
    <p class="chorus">ls your all on the altar of sacrifice laid? Your heart does the Spirit control? You can only be blest, and have peace and sweet rest, As you yield him your body and soul.</p>
