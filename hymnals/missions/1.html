      <h1>The Ninety and Nine</h1>
      <p class="verse">
        There were ninety and nine that safely lay, In the shelter of the fold,
        But one was out on the hills away, Far off from the gates of gold. Away
        on the mountains wild and bare, Away from the tender shepherd's care,
        Away from the tender shepherd's care.
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        Lord, thou hast here thy ninety and nine, Are they not enough for thee?
        But the shepherd made answer, &quot;This of mine, Has wandered away from
        me. And although the road be rough and steep, I go to the desert to find
        my sheep, I go to the desert to find my sheep.
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        But none of the ransomed ever knew, How deep were the waters crossed,
        Nor how dark was the night that the Lord passed through, Ere he found
        his sheep that was lost. Out in the desert he heard its cry, Sick and
        helpless, and ready to die, Sick and helpless, and ready to die.
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        Lord, whence are those blood drops all the way, That mark out the
        mountain's track? They were shed for one who had gone astray, Ere the
        shepherd could bring him back. Lord, whence are thy hands so rent and
        torn? They're pierced tonight by many a thorn. They're pierced tonight
        by many a thorn.
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        But all through the mountains, thunder riven, And up from the rocky
        steep, There arose a glad cry to the gate of heaven, Rejoice, I have
        found my sheep. And the angels echoed around the throne, Rejoice for the
        Lord brings back his own, Rejoice for the Lord brings back his own.
