    <h1>Footsteps of Jesus</h1>
    <p class="verse">Sweetly, Lord, have we heard thee calling, come, follow me. And we see where thy footprints falling, lead us to thee.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Footprints of Jesus, that make the pathway glow, We will follow the steps of Jesus, where'er they go.</p>
    <p class="verse">Though they lead o'er the cold, dark mountains, seeking his sheep, Or along by Siloam's fountains, helping the weak,</p>
    <p class="chorus">Footprints of Jesus, that make the pathway glow, We will follow the steps of Jesus, where'er they go.</p>
    <p class="verse">If they lead through the temple holy, preaching the word, Or in homes of the poor and lowly, serving the Lord,</p>
    <p class="chorus">Footprints of Jesus, that make the pathway glow, We will follow the steps of Jesus, where'er they go.</p>
    <p class="verse">Then at last, when on high he sees us, our journey done, We will rest where the steps of Jesus end at his throne.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Footprints of Jesus, that make the path-way glow, We will follow the steps of Jesus, where'er they go.</p>
