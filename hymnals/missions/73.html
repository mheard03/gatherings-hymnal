    <h1>Bring Them in</h1>
    <p class="verse">Hark, 'tis the shepherd's voice I hear, Out in the desert dark and drear, Calling the sheep who've gone astray, Far from the shepherd's fold away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Bring them in, bring them in, Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in, bring them in, Bring the wand'ring ones to Jesus.</p>
    <p class="verse">Who'll go and help this shepherd kind, Help him the wand'ring ones to find? Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold, Where they'll be sheltered from the cold?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Bring them in, bring them in, Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in, bring them in, Bring the wand'ring ones to Jesus.</p>
    <p class="verse">Out in the desert, hear their cry, Out on the mountains, wild and high. Hark, 'tis the Master speaks to thee, &quot;Go find my sheep, where e'er they be.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Bring them in, bring them in, Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in, bring them in, Bring the wand'ring ones to Jesus.</p>
