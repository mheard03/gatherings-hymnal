    <h1>Launch Out Into the Deep</h1>
    <p class="verse">The mercy of God is an ocean divine, A boundless and fathomless flood. Launch out in the deep, cut away the shoreline, And be lost in the fullness of God.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Launch out (launch out) into the deep (into the deep), Oh, let the shoreline go Launch out, launch out in the ocean divine, Out where the full tides flow.</p>
    <p class="verse">But many, alas, only stand on the shore, And gaze on the ocean so wide, They never have ventured its depths to explore, Or to launch on the fathomless tide.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Launch out (launch out) into the deep (into the deep), Oh, let the shoreline go Launch out, launch out in the ocean divine, Out where the full tides flow.</p>
    <p class="verse">Oh let us launch out on this ocean so broad, Where floods of salvation e'er flow, Oh, let us be lost in the mercy of God, Till the depths of His fullness we know.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Launch out (launch out) into the deep (into the deep), Oh, let the shoreline go Launch out, launch out in the ocean divine, Out where the full tides flow.</p>
    <p class="verse">Launch out, oh, launch out where the breakers are high, Where souls sink beneath the dark wave, Launch out in the deep 'ere they languish and die, Bring them safely to Christ who can save.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Launch out (launch out) into the deep (into the deep), Oh, let the shoreline go Launch out, launch out in the ocean divine, Out where the full tides flow.</p>
