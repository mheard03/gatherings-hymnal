    <h1>Labor On</h1>
    <p class="verse">In the harvest field there is work to do, For the grain is ripe, and the reapers few And the Master's voice bids the workers true, Heed the call that He gives today.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Labor on, labor on, keep the bright reward in view. For the Master has said He will strength renew, Labor on till the close of day.</p>
    <p class="verse">Crowd the garner well with its sheaves all bright, Let the song be glad, and the heart be light, Fill the precious hours, 'ere the shades of night, Take the place of the golden day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Labor on, labor on, keep the bright reward in view. For the Master has said He will strength renew, Labor on till the close of day.</p>
    <p class="verse">In the gleaner's path may be rich reward, Though the time seems long, and the labor hard, For the Master's joy, with His chosen shared, Drives the gloom from the darkest day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Labor on, labor on, keep the bright reward in view. For the Master has said He will strength renew, Labor on till the close of day.</p>
