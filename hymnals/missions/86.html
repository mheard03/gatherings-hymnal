    <h1>Hear O Hear</h1>
    <p class="verse">Hear, O hear the Saviour calling, who will work for me today? Souls are dying in the dark-ness, who will point them to the way?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hear O hear the voice of Jesus, He is calling you and me. Let us answer, quickly answer, Saviour, we will go for thee.</p>
    <p class="verse">Go and tell them 'ere they perish, tell them of a Savior&rsquo;s love. They have never heard the message, tell them of a home above.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hear O hear the voice of Jesus, He is calling you and me. Let us answer, quickly answer, Saviour, we will go for thee.</p>
    <p class="verse">Some from every tribe and nation must be gathered to the fold. Go and tell them, hasten, hasten, let the story now be told.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Hear O hear the voice of Jesus, He is calling you and me. Let us answer, quickly answer, Saviour, we will go for thee.</p>
