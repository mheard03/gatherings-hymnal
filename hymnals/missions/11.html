      <h1>Satisfied With Jesus</h1>
      <p class="verse">
        I am satisfied with Jesus, he has done so much for me, He has suffered
        to redeem me, he has died to set me free.
      </p>
      <p class="chorus">
        I am satisfied. I am satisfied. I am satisfied with Jesus, But the
        question comes to me, as I think of Calvary, Is my Master satisfied with
        me?
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        I can hear the voice of Jesus, calling out so pleadingly, Go and win the
        lost and straylng, is he satisfied with me?
      </p>
      <p class="chorus">
        I am satisfied. I am satisfied. I am satisfied with Jesus, But the
        question comes to me, as I think of Calvary, Is my Master satisfied with
        me?
      </p>
      <p class="verse">
        When my work on earth is ended, and I cross the mystic sea, Oh, that I
        could hear him saying, &rdquo;I am satisfied with thee.&quot;
      </p>
      <p class="chorus">
        I am satisfied. I am satisfied. I am satisfied with Jesus, But the
        question comes to me, as I think of Calvary, Is my Master satisfied with
        me?
