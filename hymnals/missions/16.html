    <h1>Around the World Today</h1>
    <p class="verse">Around the world today, are billions lost in sin, Without the Savior&rsquo;s love, to give them hope within, But we can share our Christ, and pray and give and go, Give up our comforts gladly, that they might Jesus know.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It will be worth it all, when we see Jesus, Surrounded on His throne, by those we've won, The sight of that great throng, Singing redemption's song From every tribe and tongue, is worth it all.</p>
    <p class="verse">Should I give of myself, count loss what I hold dear, Spend hours and days to go, share Jesus far and near, Bear ridicule and shame, to carry Jesus' name, To someone lost in bondage, that they might freedom claim?</p>
    <p class="chorus">It will be worth it all, when we see Jesus, Surrounded on His throne, by those we've won, The sight of that great throng, Singing redemption's song From every tribe and tongue, is worth it all.</p>
    <p class="verse">Look forward to the day, when Christ will split the sky, Claim those who once were lost, in darkness without light, Rejoicing they will fly, gone dark-ness guilt and shame, For some-one took the message, &quot;Believe on ]esus' name.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">It will be worth it all, when we see Jesus, Surrounded on His throne, by those we've won, The sight of that great throng, Singing redemption's song From every tribe and tongue, is worth it all.</p>
    <p class="verse">It costs a lot to send, the sacrifice is great, For those who up and go, and those who send and stay. The cost of what we spend, is measured here in gold, But over up in glory, one soul is worth the world.</p>
    <p class="chorus">It will be worth it all, when we see Jesus, Surrounded on His throne, by those we've won, The sight of that great throng, Singing redemption's song From every tribe and tongue, is worth it all.</p>
