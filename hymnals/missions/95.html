    <h1>I'll Go Where You Want Me To Go</h1>
    <p class="verse">It may not be on the mountain's height, or over the stormy sea, It may not be at the battle's front, my Lord will have need of me, But if by a still, small voice he calls, to paths I do not know, I'll answer, &quot;Dear Lord, with my hand in thine,</p>
    <p class="chorus">l'll go where you want me to go I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord, O'er mountain, or plain, or sea. I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord, I'll be what you want me to be.</p>
    <p class="verse">There's surely somewhere a lowly place, In earth's harvest fields so wide, Where I may labor through life's short day, For Jesus, the crucified. So, trusting my all unto thy care, I know thou lovest me, I'll do thy will with a heart sincere, I'll be what you want me to be.</p>
    <p class="chorus">l'll go where you want me to go I'll go where you want me to go, dear Lord, O'er mountain, or plain, or sea. I'll say what you want me to say, dear Lord, I'll be what you want me to be.</p>
