    <h1>One More Day</h1>
    <p class="verse">One more day's work for Jesus, one less of life for me, But heaven is nearer and Christ is dearer than yester-day to me, His love and light fill all my soul tonight.</p>
    <p class="chorus">One more day's work for Jesus, One more day's work for Jesus, One more day's work for Jesus, one less of life for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">One more day's work for Jesus, how sweet the work has been, To tell the story, to show the glory, where Christ's flock enter in How it did shine in this poor heart of mine.</p>
    <p class="chorus">One more day's work for Jesus, One more day's work for Jesus, One more day's work for Jesus, one less of life for me.</p>
    <p class="verse">O blessed work for Jesus, O rest at Jesus feet. There toil seems pleasure, my wants are treasure, and pain For him is sweet. Lord if I may, l'll serve another day.</p>
    <p class="chorus">One more day's work for Jesus, One more day's work for Jesus, One more day's work for Jesus, one less of life for me.</p>
