    <h1>Softly and Tenderly</h1>
    <p class="verse">Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling, calling for you and for me, See, on the portals he's waiting and watching, Watching for you and for me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Come home, come home, ye who are weary come home. Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home.</p>
    <p class="verse">Why should we tarry when Jesus is pleading, Pleading for you and for me? Why should we linger and heed not his mercies, Mercies for you and for me?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Come home, come home, ye who are weary come home. Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home.</p>
    <p class="verse">Time is now fleeting; the moments are passing, Passing from you and from me. Shadows are gathering, death-beds are coming, Coming for you and for me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Come home, come home, ye who are weary come home. Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home.</p>
    <p class="verse">O for the wonderful love he has promised, Promised for you and for me, Though we have sinned he has mercy and pardon, Pardon for you and for me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Come home, come home, ye who are weary come home. Earnestly, tenderly, Jesus is calling, Calling, O sinner, come home.</p>
