    <h1>I Can Hear Him Calling Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">With my eyes upon the Master, I must follow day by day, And though lonely be my pathway, yet I dare not disobey. I must go and preach the gospel to the lands beyond the sea, For the Master calls for workers, and I hear him calling me.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I can hear him calling me, to the lands beyond the sea, He is bidding me to take the gospel there. I can hear him calling me, Jesus Christ of Calvary, I will answer him and follow anywhere.</p>
    <p class="verse">He is with me every moment, for he never will forsake. Then to souls in heathen darkness, I'll his message gladly take, There are tribes that still must hear it, 'Ere his church will be complete, I must gather out a people, who will bow at Jesus' feet.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I can hear him calling me, to the lands beyond the sea, He is bidding me to take the gospel there. I can hear him calling me, Jesus Christ of Calvary, I will answer him and follow anywhere.</p>
