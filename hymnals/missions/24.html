    <h1>So Little Time</h1>
    <p class="verse">So little time, the harvest will be over, Our reaping done, we reapers taken home. Report our work to Jesus, Lord of harvest, And hope he'll smile, and that he'll say, &quot;Well done.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Today we reap, or miss our golden harvest. Today is given us lost souls to win. Oh, then to save some dear one from the burning, Today we'll go, to bring some sinner in.</p>
    <p class="verse">Despite the heat, the ceaseless toil, the hardship. The broken heart, o'er those we cannot win. Misunderstood because we're oft peculiar, Still no regrets we'll have, but for our sin.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Today we reap, or miss our golden harvest. Today is given us lost souls to win. Oh, then to save some dear one from the burning, Today we'll go, to bring some sinner in.</p>
    <p class="verse">A day of pleasure, or a feast of friendship, A house or car, or garments fair, or fame, Will all be trash, when souls are brought to heaven, And then how sad, to face the slacker's shame.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Today we reap, or miss our golden harvest. Today is given us lost souls to win. Oh, then to save some dear one from the burning, Today we'll go, to bring some sinner in.</p>
    <p class="verse">The harvest white, with reapers few, is wasting, And many souls will die and never know, The love of Christ, the joy of sins forgiven, Oh, let us weep, and love, and pray, and go.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Today we reap, or miss our golden harvest. Today is given us lost souls to win. Oh, then to save some dear one from the burning, Today we'll go, to bring some sinner in.</p>
