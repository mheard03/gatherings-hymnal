    <h1>Why Not Now?</h1>
    <p class="verse">While we pray and while we plead, While you see your soul's deep need, While your father calls you home, will you not, my brother come?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not now, why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now, why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?</p>
    <p class="verse">You have wandered far away, do not risk another day, Do not turn from God your face, but today accept his grace,</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not now, why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now, why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?</p>
    <p class="verse">In the world you've failed to find Aught of peace for troubled mind, Come to Christ, on him believe, peace and joy you shall receive.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not now, why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now, why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?</p>
    <p class="verse">Come to Christ, confession make, come to Christ and pardon take, Trust in him from day to day, He will keep you all the way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Why not now, why not now? Why not come to Jesus now? Why not now, why not now? Why not come to Jesus now?</p>
