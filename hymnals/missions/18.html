    <h1>We&rsquo;ve a Story to Tell</h1>
    <p class="verse">We've a story to tell to the nations, That shall turn their heart to the right. A story of truth and sweet- ness, A story of peace and light, A story of peace and light.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For the darkness shall turn to dawning, And the dawning to noonday bright, And Christ's great kingdom shall come to earth, The kingdom of love and light.</p>
    <p class="verse">We've a song to be sung to the nations That shall lift their hearts to the Lord. A song that shall conquer evil and shatter the spear and sword, And shatter the spear and sword.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For the darkness shall turn to dawning, And the dawning to noonday bright, And Christ's great kingdom shall come to earth, The kingdom of love and light.</p>
    <p class="verse">We've a message to give to the nations That the Lord who reigneth above: Hath sent us His son to save us, and show us that God is love, And show us that God is Love.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For the darkness shall turn to dawning, And the dawning to noonday bright, And Christ's great kingdom shall come to earth, The kingdom of love and light.</p>
    <p class="verse">We've a Saviour to show to the nations, Who the path of sorrow has trod That all of the world's great peoples might come to the truth of God, might come to the truth of God.</p>
    <p class="chorus">For the darkness shall turn to dawning, And the dawning to noonday bright, And Christ's great kingdom shall come to earth, The kingdom of love and light.</p>
