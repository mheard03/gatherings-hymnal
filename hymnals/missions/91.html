    <h1>Jesus IS Calling</h1>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is tenderly calling thee home, Calling today, calling today, Why from the sunshine of love wilt thou roam, Farther and farther away?</p>
    <p class="chorus">Calling today, calling today, Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is calling the weary to rest, Calling today, calling today, Bring him thy burden and thou shalt be blest, He will not turn thee away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Calling today, calling today, Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is waiting, O come to him now, Waiting today, waiting today, Come with thy sins, at his feet lowly bow, Come and no longer delay.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Calling today, calling today, Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.</p>
    <p class="verse">Jesus is pleading, O list to his voice, Hear him today, hear him today, They who believe on his name shall rejoice, Quickly arise and away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Calling today, calling today, Jesus is calling, is tenderly calling today.</p>
