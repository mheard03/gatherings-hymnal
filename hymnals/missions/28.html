    <h1>The Reaping Time is Coming</h1>
    <p class="verse">There are days of toil in the sowing time, There is need to work and pray. There are fields to scatter with precious seed, 'Ere the daylight fades away.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O the reaping time is coming, It is coming by and by, yes, it's coming by and by. O the reaping time is coming, For the Lord shall soon return.</p>
    <p class="verse">There are weary hours, when the seed is sown, And the weeds grow up so fast. There are days when barren the field appears, Yet the harvest comes at last.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O the reaping time is coming, It is coming by and by, yes, it's coming by and by. O the reaping time is coming, For the Lord shall soon return.</p>
    <p class="verse">There are bitter tears o'er the falling grain, There are prayers that soon may grow, But the measure yet, that the soil will yield, Naught but harvest time can show.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O the reaping time is coming, It is coming by and by, yes, it's coming by and by. O the reaping time is coming, For the Lord shall soon return.</p>
    <p class="verse">O, the reaping time, it must surely come, For the master's word is giv'n, That the grain from seed that the faithful sow, Shall be garnered home in heav'n.</p>
    <p class="chorus">O the reaping time is coming, It is coming by and by, yes, it's coming by and by. O the reaping time is coming, For the Lord shall soon return.</p>
