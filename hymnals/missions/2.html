    <h1>Away in Heathen Darkness</h1>
    <p class="verse">Away in heathen darkness drear, Lost souls are born and die in fear, They grope to find the light of life, To end their misery and strife Oh, you who know the way to God, Won't you to them the gospel bring? Haste then e'er more shall die in sin, And tell of Jesus' death for them.</p>
    <p class="verse">Today some heathen mother dear, Is turning from a sacred stream, To which she threw her precious child, An offering to please her god, Oh, you who know the one true God, What offering did you bring today? You claim to have the peace of God Yet care not they must seek in vain.</p>
    <p class="verse">Somewhere a man is passing on, His life and breath are almost gone, His way is dark we know full well But no one goes of Christ to tell. In misery he cries in vain, Knows not that Jesus died for him, And in a Christ-less grave he's laid, Forgotten, lost and doomed for hell.</p>
    <p class="verse">Oh, Christian friends they're dying now, Two hundred thousand souls a day, How shall we face our blessed Lord, If any longer we delay Oh, you who know the way to God, Won't you to them the gospel bring, Haste then, Oh, haste to those in sin And tell of Jesus&rsquo; death for them.</p>
