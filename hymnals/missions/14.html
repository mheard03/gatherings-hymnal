    <h1>Follow Me</h1>
    <p class="verse">I traveled down a lonely road, and no one seemed to care, The burden on my weary back had bowed me to despair. I oft complained to Jesus how folks were treating me, And then I heard him say so tenderly, &quot;My feet were also weary upon the Calvary road, The cross became so heavy I fell beneath the load. Be faithful weary pilgrim, the morning I can see, Just lift your cross and follow close to me.&quot;</p>
    <p class="verse">I work so hard for Jesus, I often boast and say, I've sacrificed a lot of things to walk the narrow way, I gave up fame and fortune, I'm worth a lot to thee, And then I hear him gently say to me, &quot;l left my throne of glory, and counted it but loss, I My hands were nailed in anger upon a cruel cross, But now we'll make the journey with your hand safe in mine, So lift your cross and follow close to me.&quot;</p>
    <p class="verse">Oh, Jesus if I die upon a foreign field someday, 'Twould be no more than love demands, no less could I repay. No greater love hath mortal man than for a friend to die,These are the words he gently spoke to me, &quot;lf just a cup of water, I place within your hand, Then just a cup of water, is all that I demand.&quot; But if by death to living, they can thy glory see, I'll take my cross and follow close to thee.</p>
