    <h1>I'm Sending You</h1>
    <p class="verse">I'm sending you to witness in the ghetto, I'm sending you to valleys made of stone, Where city walls rise high among the people, And as you go, you will not go alone.</p>
    <p class="verse">This is my world but people live in shambles, Of broken dreams, because they live in sin. Take them my word and show them that I love them, And by my grace some will understand.</p>
    <p class="verse">I'm sending you to heal the guilty- hearted, To bind the wounds, of sin- sick modern man, To take your place among my urban prophets, And as you go, you'll go by my command.</p>
    <p class="verse">I'm sending you to share my love with others, To bring new hope to men who are disowned, To give a name to those who now are nameless, I'm sending you to men who are alone.</p>
    <p class="verse">l'm sending you with pow'r uncomprehend, I'm sending you with love beyond your own. I'm giving you the last and great commission, I'll give you men wherever you may go.</p>
