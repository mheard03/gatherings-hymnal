    <h1>Tell It Again</h1>
    <p class="verse">Into the tent where a gypsy boy lay, Dying alone at the close of the day, News of salvation we carried. Said he, &quot;Nobody ever has told it to me.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell it again, tell it again, Salvation's story repeat o'er and o'er, Till none can say of the children of men, Nobody ever has told me before.</p>
    <p class="verse">quot;Did he so love me, a poor little boy, Send unto me the good tidings of joy? Need I not perish, my hand will he hold? Never to me had the story been told.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell it again, tell it again, Salvation's story repeat o'er and o'er, Till none can say of the children of men, Nobody ever has told me before.</p>
    <p class="verse">Bending, we caught the last words of his breath, Just as he entered the valley of death, &quot;God sent his son, whosoever said he, Then I am sure that he sent him for me.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell it again, tell it again, Salvation's story repeat o'er and o'er, Till none can say of the children of men, Nobody ever has told me before.</p>
    <p class="verse">Smiling, he said, as his last sigh he spent, &quot;I am so glad that for me he was sent.&quot; Whispered, while low sank the sun in the west, &quot;Lord, I believe, tell it now to the rest.&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Tell it again, tell it again, Salvation's story repeat o'er and o'er, Till none can say of the children of men, Nobody ever has told me before.</p>
