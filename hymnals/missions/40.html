    <h1>The Reaping up There</h1>
    <p class="verse">The cost of revival, the price of soul - winning, The long hours of praying, the burden, the tears, The pleading with sinners though lonely, a stranger, ls repaid at the reaping up there.</p>
    <p class="verse">The Saviour will see the travail of His soul, And be satisfied fully 0'er souls He's redeemed, Compared to that reaping He scorned all His suffering, To be paid at the reaping up there.</p>
    <p class="verse">The treasures of earth, oh, how vain and how fleeting, They vanish like mist and they wither like leaves, But souls who are won by our tears and our pleading, Will remain for our reaping up there.</p>
    <p class="verse">To come to that reaping with wood, hay, and stubble, How sad to appear at the Lord's judgement seat, With no one we've won to salvation in Jesus, To present at the reaping up there.</p>
    <p class="verse">The wise, they shall shine like the firmament glory, When payday shall come for the winner of souls, Then they who've reaped many by salvation's story, Like the stars, blessed forever, shall shine.</p>
