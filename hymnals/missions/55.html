    <h1>Till Every Tribe Shall Hear</h1>
    <p class="verse">How well we love the story of the blessed son of God. How he purchased our redemption when up Calvary hill he trod. How he told the ones who loved him they must tell his love abroad,</p>
    <p class="chorus">Till every tribe shall hear. Go to every tongue and nation, With the message of salvation Bring them joyful consolation; Till every tribe shall hear.</p>
    <p class="verse">But there are many millions, who have never heard His name, They've no hope of life eternal, they cannot salvation claim, For they do not know the message Jesus told us to proclaim,</p>
    <p class="chorus">Till every tribe shall hear. Go to every tongue and nation, With the message of salvation Bring them joyful consolation; Till every tribe shall hear.</p>
    <p class="verse">The day of God is coming when the church of Christ shall stand, Face to face with Christ her Saviour in the blessed glory land. And we each shall give our answer, &quot;Did you hasten my command?&quot;</p>
    <p class="chorus">Till every tribe shall hear. Go to every tongue and nation, With the message of salvation Bring them joyful consolation; Till every tribe shall hear.</p>
