    <h1>Win Them for Him</h1>
    <p class="verse">Just to tell the Savior&rsquo;s story, just to witness for his glory, There are many waiting in their doubt and blindness, Win them for him. Speak a word to friend or neighbor, joyous for the Master labor, Telling of his joy divine, his love and kindness, Win them for him.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Serve him, labor for his glory, And your witness he will bless. Serve him, tell the wondrous story, And his love divine confess, and gladly Serve him, pointing those around you To the light that ne'er can dim. Haste, for days are winging, Souls to Jesus bringing, win them for Him.</p>
    <p class="verse">Just a word the King confessing, Just to point the path to blessing, Some have never, never heard the call so tender, Win them for him. There is work that waits your doing, Eager haste, your strength renewing, Service for the Master you can daily render, Win them for him.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Serve him, labor for his glory, And your witness he will bless. Serve him, tell the wondrous story, And his love divine confess, and gladly Serve him, pointing those around you To the light that ne'er can dim. Haste, for days are winging, Souls to Jesus bringing, win them for Him.</p>
    <p class="verse">Just to live a life so lowly, witness for the King so holy, Let your light so shine that those around may know him, Win them for him. Just a word, his voice obeying, just a word to help the straying, Tell them of a Saviour blest, how much we owe him, Win them for him.</p>
    <p class="chorus">Serve him, labor for his glory, And your witness he will bless. Serve him, tell the wondrous story, And his love divine confess, and gladly Serve him, pointing those around you To the light that ne'er can dim. Haste, for days are winging, Souls to Jesus bringing, win them for Him.</p>
