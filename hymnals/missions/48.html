    <h1>My Desire</h1>
    <p class="verse">I want my life to glorify my Lord and King, I want to please and honor Him in everything, I want my life to tell men that He is my guide, I want the world to know He's walking by my side.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I want to live as Jesus lived, I want to love as Jesus loved, I want to serve and honor Him, And please him in everything. I want to live as Jesus lived, I want to love as Jesus loved, I want my life to testify that He's my Lord and King.</p>
    <p class="verse">Oh, that my life might magnify the Saviour's power, Oh that my deeds might witness to His grace each hour, Oh that my words might magnify His holy name, So let my heart and voice His mighty power proclaim.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I want to live as Jesus lived, I want to love as Jesus loved, I want to serve and honor Him, And please him in everything. I want to live as Jesus lived, I want to love as Jesus loved, I want my life to testify that He's my Lord and King.</p>
    <p class="verse">I want my life to testify that He can save, I want to help to make His crimson banner wave, I want to tell the blessed story every day, I want to be a light to others on their way.</p>
    <p class="chorus">I want to live as Jesus lived, I want to love as Jesus loved, I want to serve and honor Him, And please him in everything. I want to live as Jesus lived, I want to love as Jesus loved, I want my life to testify that He's my Lord and King.</p>
