    <h1>What Can I Give Jesus?</h1>
    <p class="verse">What can I give to Jesus, who gave himself for me? How can I show my love for Him, who died on Calvary? l'll give my life to Jesus, and calmly, gladly rest, Each future hope and fond desire upon his loving breast.</p>
    <p class="verse">l'll give my voice to Jesus, and seek through all my days, My every talent consecrate to sing his joyous praise. I'll give my strength to Jesus of head, of heart and will, Go where He sends and ever strive His purpose to fulfill.</p>
    <p class="verse">l'll give my wealth to Jesus, though little I possess. Take what I am and what I have, dear Lord, accept and bless. What can I give to Jesus, who gave himself for me?I'll give my all to Jesus, who died on Calvary.</p>
